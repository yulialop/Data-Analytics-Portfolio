I was so excited to get these because I thought it would be a great healthy snack to keep at my desk. I ordered these and other flavor (double chocolate chunk) and after eating a couple of each, noticed that one of the cookies had bluish green mold on it. I assumed it was a bad one in the batch. I saw on the manufacturer's website that these should be stored in the freezer since the shelf life is 90 days (due to natural ingredients and no preservatives). I immediately put them in the freezer after getting them 3 weeks earlier. The next 4 cookies I opened had that same mold on it and after I examine the rest, I found that they all were moldy. Apparently Amazon had them stored in their warehouse for a while before I rec'd them. Since there were no dates stamped on the cookies, I have no idea how long they sat in the warehouse before I got them.I will not be ordering these again and will be wary of ordering other food products from Amazon.com.

1,B079JR2YL5,Grocery,"VEGETARIAN PLUS Vegetarian Orange Chicken, 10.5 OZ",Vegetarian Plus,"You know those soft, artist's pencil erasers you knead in your hand to clean? Like that, with sauce. Completely unpalatable. Would not serve this to a wild coyote (and they'll eat anything). You know those soft, light gray pencil erasers you knead in your hand to clean, and when you stretch them, they get light and airy? This is like that, with sauce. Not even kidding. If you buy this, think of that image while chewing on one of the chicken gumballs (for lack of a better word) for a while--and I assure you it will be a WHILE. The texture of these things falls somewhere between bubble gum, erasers and marshmallows. And they taste like, well, nothing really, with a faint hint of latex, perhaps (might be the bag you microwave it in--which melts!). Yes, this is that bad. Truly an extremely unpleasant thing to put in your mouth. As I chewed the first one up (took a few minutes--they do not break down the way actual FOOD does when you chew it), I could not help but wonder if this would digest properly. I felt like I was eating something from art class, and when I swallowed it, I felt like I had swallowed my chewing gum or something. Absolutely disgusting.This is *not* food.Make sure you read the instructions closely--there is a second bag within the outer bag. Unlike most entrees you heat up in right the packaging, you have to first remove the inner bag from the outer bag. Not sure why they go to the trouble of double-bagging, but this seems misleading (it looks like a larger portion than what is actually in the bag) is not environmentally friendly, and can be confusing--read the instructions closely if you still want to give this a try. Flavor: 0/10, texture: -1/10, packaging 0/10.Oh, and please note the microwave instructions are simply wrong. This was delivered frozen from Whole Foods via Amazon, but I am not sure it is actually meant to be frozen. Following the microwave directions means you are giving this less than half the amount of time actually required to heat up properly. I had to put it in for another two minutes to get it hot enough to serve (it was still partially frozen after following the directions--and I have a 1100w microwave), which made part of the inner bag melt. Really not cool. Pretty sure the end result is a lot of free radicals in your dinner. I threw it out after 2 bites. I absolutely do NOT recommend this product. It was disappointing on every level--just terrible.",446,27,1,0.9512073397636414,0.02386738732457161,0.004839320667088032,0.004403688944876194,0.007286467589437962,0.007904397323727608,0.0004913621232844889,Disgust,0.9815234541893005,0.9257685542106628,0.6840359568595886,0.987933337688446,0.6096051335334778,0.7222371697425842,0.7645767331123352,0.8976134061813354,0.6278625130653381,0.8954987525939941,0.7295830845832825,0.02367999404668808,0.2518858313560486,0.018446505069732666,Taste and Flavour

I don't normally write reviews but this product is so awful I felt compelled. I bought this based on 2 things. One is that it was advertised as BLACK tea and the other that it had peach in it. The picture made it seem there were bits of dried peach in the tea bag. Not only is it CEYLON tea (which I hate) but it tastes nothing like peach and there are no peach bits in the tea bag. Worst of all, after preparing 2 cups (the second with an extra tea bag in the cup to see if I'd get more of a peach taste), I could not get the aftertaste to go away.

1,B0B7ZHSLTD,Grocery,"True Lime Black Cherry Limeade, 10 Count, Pack of 2",True Citrus,"So gross, I couldn't finish the 1st serving! For a brand with 'True' in the name, they really fall short, and even go so far as to make it difficult to realize all the ingredients are not 'truly' good for you. Such as the fact that it contains, Stevia, which is not mentioned on the front of the box, as it should, to be less deceptive. If it had said it on the front, I would not have bought it! Although Stevia is a 'natural ingredient', that does not automatically make it good for you, or make the product taste good. It does say it in the tiny ingredient list I had to zoom in to see on my phone camera, and on the back. Nowhere is it on the front of the box, where is the place consumers see first. Not to mention that this was truly disgusting! I thought maybe it just needed a second one for the amount of water I had in my jug, but even adding a second serving didn't help. Stevia can cause uncomfortable side effects, like possibly, diarrhea, in those with gastric sensitivities! Stevia is almost as bad as Nutrasweet, which includes phenylalanine, which can cause cancer. So I was looking for something 100% natural, with REAL sugar, and nothing else pretending to be. So if that's what you want too, don't buy this. I had set up an auto subscription, but after tasting this, I immediately cancelled it. Hopefully, my roommate can stand the taste.

They misrepresented what was being sent and I resent it since it was a disaster to even get them out of the wrapper not to mention the container. My fingers were covered in marshmallow along with everything it came in. I was sorely disappointed in this product.

Nothing beats a creamy, sugary cup of steaming hot tea on a cold and rainy day (I live in Washington, so I drink a lot of tea).I usually buy loose tea at the grocery store, the price isn't great at $24.99lb but the taste is so far above the drab Lipton tea bags I grew up with that now I can't bear to drink tea from teabags. It's like watching television on a tiny black and white after a few weeks of using a a nice flatscreen, horrible and strange.The price for this Davidson's Irish Breakfast was so much lower than what I get at the grocery store that I thought, 'ha! It must be my lucky day!'Well, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.From the moment I opened the bag, the tea smelled wrong. I still had a few teaspoons of Irish Breakfast from my last visit to the grocery store and when I compared the teas they looked noticeably different. The grocery tea, hereafter known as 'Good Tea' was darker, the tea leaves more solid with occasional bits of bronzyness scattered willy nilly throughout. The 'Good Tea' was not just slightly darker, it was several shades darker. Also, the Davidson's Irish Breakfast had a grayish-green tinge to it. In fact, it looked a lot like the oolong tea I bought last year and have yet to finish (guess I'm not an oolong girl).I made a cup for my hubby, adding just the right amount of cream and sugar. When he's busy working, sometimes I think he'd drink a cup of soy sauce, as long as it was hot and he didn't have to fetch it himself, he's just so distracted, but he took one sip of the Davidson's and made a sour face. Anyways, he wouldn't drink it and I had to toss my cup down the drain too. There's no amount of sugar, cream or lemon slices that can fix this hellish brew.

I have bought these caramels several times, they are my favorites. I purchased these a couple weeks ago and it was time to break into my favorite treat. I was surprised to find melted caramel inside the container. When I tried to unwrap the caramel it was extremely soft, the paper stuck to it and I had to scrape if off the paper. Usually they are firm, hold their shape and come off the paper easily. It also has no sea salt taste. I am hoping this is a anomaly and not their usual going forward.

Personally, I prefer milk chocolate. I have gotten these many times as just a treat to keep on hand, thinking of the benefits I am getting.Then I did more research.....THESE are processed with ALKALI....It's also called DUTCH processing.

1,B008GG75QC,Grocery,"Hoosier Hill Farm Premium Arrowroot Powder, 1 Lb.",Hoosier Hill Farm,"Thickens on par with corn starch, NOT xanthan gum - A review for medically-required usage. Have been using Xanthan Gum for a couple of years (after discovering how much cheaper it was, because I had to use so much less, than the Thick-It 2 food thickener. Unfortunately, my kid developed something that is shortened into EoE, and the three triggers are dairy, nuts, xanthan gum. I had really hoped that Arrowroot Powder would have the thickening capabilities of Xanthan Gum, but it sadly does not...not by a mile. I would guess this is more consistent with using plain corn starch. By the time I used enough to barely come close to the thickness we needed (stiff pudding), you could taste the Arrowroot Powder and were also aware of the chalky texture from needing so much Arrowroot Powder. Also, as my kid is a heavy drooler, after a few bites, if any of his (slobber) was on the spoon and re-entered the bowl, the Arrowroot thickness would disappear. I can't recommend this for medically necessary thickening (for poor swallowers), but it might be fine for baking or what have you.",192,8,2,0.012447288259863853,0.17489378154277802,0.0772932767868042,0.7179669141769409,0.003343320218846202,0.00836856197565794,0.005686853546649218,Sadness,0.9269688725471497,0.4949333965778351,0.4499779939651489,0.16534771025180817,0.20008836686611176,0.26696157455444336,0.6837747097015381,0.10108773410320282,0.5956174731254578,0.1620241403579712,0.27295300364494324,0.3034581243991852,0.16578230261802673,0.04338212311267853,Not as Expected

1,B08MXN11MX,Grocery,"HERSHEY'S Organic Milk Chocolate Candy, Individually Wrapped, 1.55 oz Bar (12 Count)",HERSHEY'S,"Waxy, hard, plastic like. Doesn't melt in mouth, barely softens in microwave. Use in trail mix. (yuck!!))WHY THE DIFFERENCE? Here are the ingredients for the regular milk chocolate bar versus this organic chocolate bar: I see they omit milk fat and soy lecithin (fat emulsifier), which is basically taking those out is what makes this taste like plastic. They cheaped out taking out these items. If they wanted to make a ""soy free"" item there are alternatives available. I will not be repurchasing this, I will not recommend it. If the formula ever changes to give it a better mouth feel, then I would consider again. I normally love Hersheys, but this is a huge HECK NO from me.(regular recipe): MILK CHOCOLATE [SUGAR; MILK; CHOCOLATE; COCOA BUTTER; MILK FAT; LECITHIN (SOY); PGPR; NATURAL FLAVOR](organic): ORGANIC MILK CHOCOLATE (ORGANIC SUGAR, ORGANIC COCOA* BUTTER, ORGANIC MILK, ORGANIC CHOCOLATE).---->>>1 star. My rating is based primarily how this tastes in comparison to regular Hershey's chocolate bars. I think it is fair to do this because I am sure there are others that may give this a try thinking that it will at least resemble a Hershey's product. NOPE! It is an entirely different product. The taste, texture, and smell is just different. It isn't ""bad"" for chocolate flavor, but it is incredibly disappointing if expecting it to resemble the original base formula. There are other healthy recipe chocolates out there that far exceed this.It does NOT have a good mouth feel; it does not have a melt in mouth creaminess to it. It doesn't even melt when placed in microwave. Perhaps with more time it would, but I just put it in there to give it a try---I was just curious to see if it would soften up with any sort of heat. I gave it 10 seconds and expected it to soften. Nope. I gave it another 10, and then another 10. Only at the 30 second mark did it become less ""hard"", but it didn't soften. There was no glorious chocolate experience. Had that been the regular chocolate bar, it would have been soft at 10 seconds. Or in my mouth, or in my pocket.Waxy, hard, plastic like. Once I get chewing the chocolate flavor is ok, but it doesn't taste like Hershey's, at all. And as mentioned, sure doesnt feel like it.I'll stick to the regular Hershey's for the occasional chocolate treat. I dont eat this stuff enough to try to switch to a ""healthy"" version. I got this because I was curious. Other reviews said it was bad. I thought how bad can it be? I am an avid reviewer and like trying different stuff and giving it my thoughts in a review. I should have saved my money and heeded the bad reviews because this is not a pleasing product at all. I had also bought it to be used as part of a treat bag for some of my older friends. Just a ""thinking of you"" gift. I will NOT be adding this in. I would be embarrassed to add this in. I tucked it into my cupboard for possible use in baking, or for use as barter if TEOTWAWKI occurs. :PSo yeh, not one to waste.. I'll use up these bars in baking or break them up for use in a trail mix. But for noshing? nope, no way.

The package says FRESH. The price says FRESH. The chicken I got says that it's not being handled very carefully (and that's at best).Near where I live, you can get a freshly killed chicken (odd in the city, but it's right there - not in any special neighborhood or anything, just a poultry processor right there next to the hardware store).If you can bear the stench, you can get the freshest chicken you will ever eat. It's expensive, but it is a revelation.This chicken is nowhere near that good.But it's better than most of what you get at the supermarket. The amount of liquid at the bottom of the pan was a bit suspect, but, again, it wasn't as bad as the ones where you know without a doubt that liquid and.or salt were injected into the bird to add to the weight.

1,B0BFCY389H,Grocery,Don Pablo Gourmet Coffee - Signature Blend - Medium Dark Roast - Whole Bean Coffee - 100% Arabica Beans - Low Acidity and Non-GMO - 2lb bag,Cafe Don Pablo,"From an actual experienced barista: Don’t buy it. I wrote a good review too quickly. I’m changing it now and I have quite the opposite to say.I originally said how great a bargain it was and how pretty the beans were and how great it smelled, etc........I even made a cup of coffee which I thought was okay for the price. But, I had a lot of milk and honey in it that day due to trying to not have too much caffeine that evening.But the biggest issue was that the grind I used was actually mixed in with another brand. My wife ground some the night prior and stored it in the mason jar which she uses early in the morning if everyone’s asleep.Okay first: the coffee is about the quality of generic motel coffee. Actually, I’d rather have motel coffee. This “signature” label stuff is disgusting.Second: it’s weak....Third: it grinds chunky and weird. You get big chunky bits. And I know all about coffee grinds, I used to be a barista at an actual cafe (not a chain). I know what I’m doing.Fourth: I think the “sheen” of the beans is somehow manufactured, not the actual production of healthy oily beans and that’s why it doesn’t grind correctly. As if they were old dry stale beans and they lather them in some oil at some point before packaging.I even tried to just make cold brew out of it because you go through a lot of beans to make a good batch......and it’s disgusting. I tried a percolator too. There’s just no win for this coffee.I think all the good reviews are a mix of people who maybe got a good batch, false reviews, people who just don’t care if coffee tastes like crap because it’s so cheap and maybe at some point they were making good coffee and due to immense pressure to make more......they have failed roasting standards.I’m tossing the bag.",328,15,1,0.9712543487548828,0.010587581433355808,0.0022090745624154806,0.0030547010246664286,0.007753138896077871,0.004721707198768854,0.0004193737986497581,Disgust,0.9897944331169128,0.9486262202262878,0.31583526730537415,0.6728432178497314,0.5024199485778809,0.4822002351284027,0.7268766164779663,0.6824330687522888,0.7471230030059814,0.22950802743434906,0.4173564016819,0.47223979234695435,0.22602081298828125,0.10067249834537506,Not as Expected

1,B08CSTZ7X7,Grocery,"Organic Sea Moss Gel (8 FLAVORS) - 16 Ounce - REAL FRUIT - Wildcrafted Sea Moss (Raspberry, Pineapple Mango, Strawberry, Lemon-Ginger, Apple, Berry Mix, Elderberry)",EverSmith Organics,"Failed in what it was suggested it could do. I bought this for a fine person of the female persuasion who was, and still is, agonizing with as of now yet to be determined condition. As of late, most are aware, the medical professionals are very hesitant to provide real pain killers, recommending light weight options like Tylenol, Ibuprofen, which is kind of like a joke for those who suffer and need some kind of relief. Her situation is a work in progress, and another problem attributed to the cursed pandemic, is that appointments are far in between. So a person suggested to her this product, saying it would calm her difficult around the clock pain, and for the hefty price of $32 plus for a 16 oz container, must report that it did in no way offer relief of any kind. Of course there is that arguments that states that everyone is different and that what works for some, it might not for others, which I truly believe is baloney on wheat. Pain medication, and I am not talking about the hard core addicts that probably have scared doctors from prescribing a reliable and efficient pain pill, like oxycodene and now resort to over the counter ones, and to add insult to injury, the ones they prescribe which cost a pretty penny out of pocket, are all but useless. So finishing with this highly praised whatever is supposed to be Sea Moss Gel, it definitely not helpful for acute pain, and for those that can afford its steep price it must certainly provide some kind of benefit to have so many praising it, but helping with pain it not one of its virtues. 1 Star.",286,9,1,0.06218476966023445,0.5791016221046448,0.010940222069621086,0.0298968143761158,0.027310272678732872,0.28754422068595886,0.0030221024062484503,Neutral,0.9761044979095459,0.8323512077331543,0.46320822834968567,0.06623468548059464,0.5133212804794312,0.07479206472635269,0.9612123966217041,0.5157485008239746,0.6597079038619995,0.39373594522476196,0.3555077910423279,0.27131399512290955,0.11660601943731308,0.07355138659477234,Not as Expected

1,B00LB57BBO,Grocery,"Eggo Thick and Fluffy Frozen Waffles, Frozen Breakfast, Breakfast Food, Original, 11.6oz Box (6 Waffles)",Eggo,"I don't know why I keep hoping Eggo waffles will one day be good. I love waffles. I grew up with my dad making them on Sunday mornings every week like clockwork throughout my childhood. I have his recipe (unbeatable, and I've tried), and I have two fantastic waffle irons, one antique like his, and another modern, high-end one. Both truly make fantastic waffles. Thing is, it's a hassle and a mess to make proper waffles. You have to use multiple mixing bowls and measuring cops, get flour everywhere sifting, and then fold the egg whites in after beating them to soft peaks right before you pour the batter into the waffle iron. This works--well. I am just too lazy for it sometimes. Also, the racket of the mixer beating the egg whites is perhaps better enjoyed post-coffee.Hence the foray into the world of frozen waffles. I've tried a lot of them, and none of them are anything like real waffles--seriously, not even close. Oddly those weird Kodiak Cakes seem to be the best frozen waffles out there to my taste, even though they are high-protein (6g/ea). I gave up on Eggo waffles long ago, as they really have nothing to do with actual waffles. They are almost a different food, definitely very Americanized. The US food industry (P&G, etc) seems to do that--take a good food and ""Americanize"" it into something ultra-cheap to produce which ends up being almost unrecognizable, far from authentic. Somehow I had a hope that this might be better as they were a specialty product. Nope, same batter, just poured (no doubt by the ton) into a slightly different machine designed to make a slightly taller waffle. Tossed them after the first two.Good thing they are ultra-cheap.

This is proving to be surprisingly hard to do. There a lot of dairy-free alternative products out there claiming to be as good as or ""better than"" the dairy alternative. I am yet to find even one that lives up to the hype. This product certainly does not. It is only useful in one capacity: straight from the fridge (cold) on untoasted bread. That's it. As soon as you apply heat to this product (i.e. spread it on anything toasted, or cook with it), it reverts back into its liquid oil state and becomes completely unpalatable. Seriously--it is disgusting. I threw it out.

I just used this for the first time and disappointed doesn't begin to describe how I feel - ripped off is more like it!I am serious about my cooking and always use the best ingredients - I even mill my own flour. I have used nothing but pure vanilla for decades. I normally purchase a 1 liter bottle of pure Mexican vanilla from my local feedstore for around $15 but this last time I went in there they were sold out and I couldn't find it - I had a special occasion coming up and after looking on amazon this brand had great reviews so I decided to try it - I'm sorry but this stuff doesn't hold a candle to the stuff I normally buy and quiet frankly I don't think its as good as the stuff you get in the grocery store.My advice is to save your hard-earned money this product is nothing but hype. And what I received was shipped from the company themselves so its authentic it just isn't worth a hoot.If you can find pure Mexican vanilla at your feed store or from vendors on the side of the road selling Mexican stuff or farmers markets - that's the stuff you want and you can buy a case for what this one bottle cost.,218,6,2,0.10437293350696564,0.08691257983446121,0.1854897290468216,0.4142608344554901,0.19334302842617035,0.006888119038194418,0.008732774294912815,Sadness,0.974514365196228,0.7359971404075623,0.6387641429901123,0.792933464050293,0.7747101783752441,0.5310877561569214,0.8485307693481445,0.6317625641822815,0.4314512312412262,0.42026054859161377,0.7129488587379456,0.3717096447944641,0.37400758266448975,0.2892908751964569,Not as Expected

1,B07KBQ9LQ9,Grocery,Nature's Guru Instant Tender Coconut Water Powder Original 10 Count Single Serve On-the-Go Drink Packets (Pack of 4),Nature's Guru,"Watch your coconut water labels, whether it's liquid or powdered product. (Updated 1/6/16). This is mostly sugar that's why sugar is listed first under ""Ingredients:"" in the packaging (FDA requires that the packaging lists each ingredient from most in the product to least in that product. Sugar is first). Next is Minerals, well potassium is a mineral that we all need and it's listed as the second ingredient, but I find it odd that it is an ingredient since the potassium should be in the coconut water powder, so they are adding potassium instead of us getting it naturally from the coconut water. Why do I know this? By FDA regulations, ingredients are the things you put into it. If it was all coconut water powder, we wouldn't see Potassium in the Ingredients list, we'd see it under the ""Nutrition Label.""Coming in dead last in the list? Coconut Water! I have been duped. I have been using coconut water flavored sugar. The least ingredient is what we thought we were buying.I've been using the product for over a year and put 2 of them in my morning protein shake... and now I find out it's sugar with some minerals and a bit of coconut water to top it off. Was it good in my shake, yeah but it is flavored sugar so let's keep that focus. If I stir it into 8oz of water, it's very unpleasant. My mistake was not caring what it tastes like in just water because I was getting my potassium boost from it in my morning shake and the price was right.I have found my replacement. Unfortunately, not at Amazon because all the coconut water powder products are too pricey for how often I use it. The replacement is slightly cheaper than Amazon, but the savings is worth the extra hassle of going to a different site and buying it separately.",319,18,2,0.31035783886909485,0.5575899481773376,0.0709296390414238,0.024342354387044907,0.02117209881544113,0.014168313704431057,0.001439796993508935,Neutral,0.9554627537727356,0.37959808111190796,0.43313637375831604,0.23810496926307678,0.07158849388360977,0.30884799361228943,0.6567285060882568,0.9754246473312378,0.5392725467681885,0.365268349647522,0.9396951198577881,0.8877449631690979,0.07006248086690903,0.022705325856804848,Packaging

I do not know enough about truffles to compare what a delicious, top-notch, grade A truffle would be, but I know that put too much of this stuff on my macaroni and cheese. When you take the cover off, the truffle-perfumed powder is very pungent. The top of the bottle has a tiny plastic lid that fills up with the powder. All you do is tip the bottle over and the powder will empty from the little reservoir. I tipped the bottle twice (even though my nose advised me not to) onto the creamy mac and cheese and stirred. I knew instantly that I should have used a MINUSCULE pinch of this stuff but now it was overpowering to the point of being inedible. I have never thrown macaroni and cheese away, and I have had my share of brands over the years. This could have been a game changer for mac n chz but now the overpowering taste makes even smelling it unbearable. I'm not sure if I should give it another try or give it away to my older (and sometimes meaner) sister. :) In all fairness, she's a great cook and she might be able to use this truffle powder and make it shine.",212,10,2,0.8733652830123901,0.07991589605808258,0.004360831342637539,0.016853446140885353,0.01724279671907425,0.006947483867406845,0.001314307563006878,Disgust,0.9649980068206787,0.9723879098892212,0.5819587111473083,0.954846203327179,0.8093847036361694,0.5083352327346802,0.6035125851631165,0.2662406265735626,0.6157500147819519,0.31340888142585754,0.5875330567359924,0.06835722923278809,0.23942337930202484,0.00541528407484293,Damaged

I won’t throw it out but it’s the worst Harney tea so far..I’ll stick with hot cinnamon spice.",88,8,2,0.930204451084137,0.0366365984082222,0.0024400262627750635,0.016228245571255684,0.006670257076621056,0.004305930808186531,0.0035144269932061434,Disgust,0.968444287776947,0.45081135630607605,0.2688319683074951,0.23124852776527405,0.0012931548990309238,0.008049423806369305,0.4543306231498718,0.5267311334609985,0.20999643206596375,0.2321891337633133,0.5671070218086243,0.08028294146060944,0.16941019892692566,0.11098520457744598,Not as Expected

Whiskey does not freeze, like most hard liquors, (80 proof and up) it has to reach -17 degrees to turn to ice.But this is not alcohol, so it did freeze and because ice expands and glass has very little give, the ice pushed the cork/top out and a lot of the 'whiskey' with it. As you can see from my pictures, the bottle arrived nearly empty, partly filled with ice. The box packaging and the Amazon box were soaked with 'whiskey' too.So the reason I am writing this instead of a review of how nice this is with Coke or mixed with cider and a slice of lemon is that for some reason you cannot return this item or get a refund.So, that's something that I think people should know before they buy this.

2,B00IB7DSGC,Grocery,"Lakewood Organic Super Veggie Low Sodium Juice, 32 Ounce (Pack of 6)",Lakewood,"TOO SPICY!!!! I'm not a fan of commercially made vegetable juice, but I drink it because I don't have to prepare it and it's supposed to be good for me. When my hands were not crippled with arthritis, I used to make my own delicious vegetable juice each morning with carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and cucumber(s). After the arthritis ruined my hands, I used to water down the low sodium V-8 from Campbell's (half H2O, half juice), warm it up, and drink it as a broth. It's OK plain or with a sandwich, but by comparison to homemade juice, V-8 tastes awful. Then while surfing the net I discovered that the other ""natural"" ingredients in V-8 are milk, poultry, fish, and beef. If I were vegan or followed a kosher diet, adding ingredients that aren't disclosed up front or on the back label, for that matter, could be disappointing. Anyway, learning about the deception motivated me to find an alternative. I happen to love Lakewood pineapple juice so I decided to give their Super Veggie a try.It tastes pretty bad and has the added negative of being too spicy/hot for me. If Lakewood had omitted or substituted those hot peppers with a more palatable vegetable I probably would have given it three or four stars, but it has to be content with the two b/c I still don't think that processed vegetable juice tastes good. However, Lakewood Organic Super Veggie is truly low in sodium, so I warm it up without diluting it and add whole milk to neutralize the taste of the spicy, stinging hot peppers. Next I'll try low fat or no fat milk and see if it has the same effect. For people who like hot peppers, enjoy!",296,13,2,0.9150070548057556,0.04749685898423195,0.003170819254592061,0.009996440261602402,0.006570378318428993,0.014950097538530827,0.0028084013611078262,Disgust,0.8377431035041809,0.806522011756897,0.5851995348930359,0.9671918153762817,0.39253324270248413,0.5893869996070862,0.6931475400924683,0.6607933640480042,0.7747262120246887,0.3164405822753906,0.7870674729347229,0.6866471767425537,0.29041731357574463,0.21656255424022675,Taste and Flavour

2,B07VV7T465,Grocery,"Taylors of Harrogate Green Tea with Jasmine, 20 Count (Pack of 6)",Taylors of Harrogate,"The shy Earl Grey for the timid. This can be either a shy Earl Grey or a shy Darjeeling. Shy in the sense that the distinctive notes that gives the tea their name aren't really there.For those who are not a fan of Bergamot, but want a black tea that hangs around in the background that doesn't come forward by much, this is the tea for you. The complete opposite of the Earl Grey Roi by M.F. The French brand can definitely make this one seem dainty. The British are not known to be dainty. Not in the teas usually nor in their food. But this one, dainty would be the word.It's not a bad tea. The color and flavor of black tea is there. The Bergamot on the other hand is quite absent. More of tease to the palate. It's a gentle tea that is smoother than T of H Afternoon Darjeeling. Makes a good tea to get through the day. Can be refreshing with some ice cubes. Easy on the palate and can go with almost any dish.The nice thing about T of H sachet is that they are all individually wrapped in a sealed bag that is waterproof. Upon opening the bag, the lack of aroma pretty much gave a good idea of how the tea would taste. Either this has been sitting on the shelf too long or this is the usual way it is made. I would not doubt it since it fits the theme of most T of H teas. Their teas tend to be on the weak and lacking side. They make T------- seem more present and prominent in taste.Even Bradleys has more of an aroma and that would be classified as a nickel tea. Although this is better than that brand in terms of not being able to smell the cheap Bergamot aroma. I would not mind drinking this on any given day if I had nothing else better. But I would not exactly think of it as an Earl Grey since it lacks that scent.For those who love their Earl Grey, this is not the one. For those who are new to Earl Grey and want a good introduction, this is not the one. For a smooth black tea that you can add citrus to or drink as is both hot or cold that lacks character, this is the one.Out of the different brands of Earl Grey I have tried, I would recommend the Earl Grey Supreme by H & Sons. The silver tips adds another angle to the tea. It is definitely a Darjeeling base that stands out equally to the Bergamot if not more than the Bergamot. That one makes a sturdy tea that allows citrus to be added and still taste great.Surprisingly, I did not expect the T of H to be this lacking on such a classic tea. I would go through this more often than cheap Earl Grey mainly for it not having that Bergamot aroma. When you double the tea bags into one cup, what you get is the Darjeeling base. The Bergamot is still hiding some where. It's missing a lot of notes quite similar to their Afternoon Darjeeling.Think of it this way. Afternoon Darjeeling without the woodsy bitterness and you have this one that they call Earl Grey. This Earl Grey with the woodsy bitterness added and you have their Afternoon Darjeeling that is rough and unrefined in taste.Most Earl Greys have a Darjeeling base. This one has the color and taste of a Darjeeling. But it lacks so many natural notes that you question what kind of Darjeeling it is other than the bottom of the barrel or something sitting around too long that a lot of flavor has faded away. The flavor is a little more bitter and heavier when you double the amount, but then it seems more Darjeeling than anything else.It is best to consider this as a black tea or plain Darjeeling and nothing more. Perhaps one can make their own Earl Grey by adding some form of grapefruit into the tea. It lacks the distinctive aroma and taste of Bergamot. This one fades into the background without a stand.I give it 2 stars for being a decent black tea. 1 star for being an Earl Grey. 4 stars for T of H keeping their teas consistent even if the theme is weak. Aside from their Afternoon Darjeeling, it is the brand to go to if you want something tamed, mild, not distinctive enough in a good way and don't want any surprises. The aroma is lacking too. It's a Darjeeling that lacks a lot of character. How T of H has managed to find a weak Darjeeling to go with a weak Bergamot and sell so much of it is amazing.I usually give certain brands a try on a variety of different teas so that I would know if they carry a similar theme or if they vary greatly. T of H does not vary much. The box and bag is usually a nicer presentation than the taste of the tea.For a good Earl Grey tea experience, the H & S does a good job with their supreme since there is more than one. You get the combo of the tea and Bergamot in a good way.For those who ever wonder if there is a tea that says, ""BERGAMOT"" more than tea, the M.F. brand is good with that and they have 3 versions with E.G. Roi being the most prominent one. As in it hangs around your taste buds longer than a breath mint can. The bitterness and aroma stays around for a long time. The leaves smell strong when they are dry and when the tea is made, your palate would definitely be knocked over. The brand has been around since the 1800's. They have their fair share in testing what works and what doesn't after a while. Every other brand on the market is quite subtle on the Bergamot.The M.F. brand is exclusive so it is not that easy to find it in the U.S. and most of the world. Only certain co. carry the brand, but it's very very limited in flavors. It is usually their signature tea that is sold. It is a hit and miss on flavors. High quality, but it is similar to a selection of pastries. Not every kind agrees with every palate. T of H is more predictable which is sort of the theme for many British made teas.If you want Bergamot that zings and has your senses wake up with a soprano note, the F&M Earl Grey would do that. That is from smelling the unopened tin that has not been opened before. I would not ever call Bergamot lemony since usually the taste is heavier and more similar to a grapefruit. The F&M one has high citrus notes.Out of all the different citrus to add to an Earl Grey, the pink grapefruit compliments it best. If you add any sweetness to it, the sweet will be in front and the bitter will come from the back as an after taste. Quite enjoyable. You know you have a good Earl Grey when you can add a citrus note to it and it still taste good. When you add that and you don't taste much of anything else then the tea is lacking in something.A splash of citrus usually compliments an Earl Grey if the Bergamot is present enough. If not, the citrus won't do much. It seems many like the Lady Grey and not realize that is what it is when they add lemon to their Earl Grey.If you add flowers to a Lady Grey, it is called a Baroness Grey. Different citrus and ingredients equal a different name since it changes the drink.",1308,70,3,0.07780785858631134,0.6640811562538147,0.007444803137332201,0.023811450228095055,0.005000333301723003,0.2111845463514328,0.010669855400919914,Neutral,0.8955546617507935,0.9260556101799011,0.8937711715698242,0.9641293883323669,0.9476029276847839,0.8886623978614807,0.8917266130447388,0.889546275138855,0.9209306240081787,0.9512768983840942,0.9376918077468872,0.6392163038253784,0.8639547824859619,0.7670773863792419,Taste and Flavour

2,B01DMCMO7O,Grocery,Julian Bakery Pure Monk | v25% Monk Fruit Extract | Sweetener | Sugar Free | 3.5oz | 100 Servings,Julian Bakery,"Very Weak and Not Eligible for Return. It takes a minimum of 3x as much as of KAL Stevia Extract to even begin to approach the same level of sweetener power.As this is only 25% Magrosides, the sweetest component (Magroside V) is even less. So compared to NuNaturals 40% Magroside V extract, this is not a concentrated deal. But lets be overly generous and assume the 25% M can be scaled upwards to be equivalent to 40% V in sweetness... in that case, the cost per ounce is $13.71 vs $32.82.Needless to say, no monk fruit extract will currently beat stevia extract on an equivalent sweetness basis. But then, we are no longer using stevia extracts due to the hormonal disruption. Nature isn't stupid... it wants you to eat fruit to spread its seed, not the leaves of the plant itself.EDIT: Julian Bakery obviously doesn't give two fracks that the Chinese manufacturer they switched to is exporting some potentially toxic, scam garbage.

I have had so many brands of stevia, some that have even come and gone, that I've lost count. I was hoping it would not have the bitterness issue so that I could use this as a cheaper alternative to what I currently love (i.e., Select Stevia).The old adage, you get what you pay for applies here. This is about 1/3 of the cost of Select Stevia, I made my usual protein shake but this time used Stevita Stevia Clear. When I started drinking it, there was no bitterness detectable. One huge hurdle is now behind me and I didn't think there would be another. Unfortunately, about a 1/4th of the way through the drink I started noticing this strange aftertaste. It wasn't a bitterness, but it was unpleasant. I couldn't finish my protein drink because of it.I don't want to waste it, so for every 5 drops of Select Stevia, I put 2 of this brand. When it's finished, I won't buy another. Yes, I know it makes Select Stevia seem cheaper if I always combine the two stevia brands, but I'm only doing this because I don't want to waste the Stevita purchase. Select Stevia alone is still better than the combination of the two brands. I am just doing this to use up the Stevita.No matter what, I keep coming back to Select Stevia. I know everyone likes different stevia brands. It really comes down to your preference. I suspect my tastes are too sensitive (not a good thing because there are a lot of foods I can't eat because of this).I think for $7.50 and current prices of liquid stevia, you may want to give this a try. It wasn't the most awful stevia I ever had. Actually, far from it. If it was, I would have thrown it in the garbage. It's just not as pleasant tasting as Select Stevia for me.

2,B013T5WBZY,Grocery,Wabash Valley Farms - Gold Medal Frosted Caramel Popcorn Glaze Mix - 28 oz,Wabash Valley Farms,Disappointed. We purchased this item hoping it would be great. First having to use so much at once was surprising. There about 3 uses per container. Second it is NOT for use in a hot plate style popper with a plastic dome lid. It clumped up and did bot coat the piece's evenly. It actually burned. Which should of not happened. We had to throw out the batch of popcorn we made due to burnt taste. The popcorn and flavor toppings are expensive to just be throwing out. Clean up was awful we used EXTREMELY hot water to soak the popper lid and hot plate it took over an hour to soak and had to be done several times to get the groves cleaned of sugar clumps. Still leaving behind a burnt smell which transferred the flavor to the next three batches of regular popcorn. We purchase only high quality organic Armish popcorn which is too expensive to waste. NOT BUY for anything other than a KETTLE POPPER! NOT for use in a hot plate style popper. This should be put in the description and on packaging. Just plain disappointed!

I just don’t understand my experience with this at all. For starters I have never had Jasmine Rice but my sister had said it was so amazing and she had planned to fix some for a meal but that was put off due to the pandemic. So I ordered this, still wanting to try it. I have no idea what brand she was using.I have no problem with tasting anything else I have eaten lately so I don’t understand why this had absolutely no flavor and I couldn’t smell any aroma from it either. I’m very disappointed because I know this is a reputable company and brand to purchase from.Maybe it’s the microwave bag version of this that is the problem. I can only hope because I have purchased this stuff in the dry version and I can’t imagine how I’ll get my family to eat all of it and have no flavor.I won’t be making a purchase of this again unless it was just the one bag that I opened. If so I will change my view and rating of this product.

In ten minutes they looked done with just some slight oozing. I am a big mozz stick fan and I can say I have had very few that didn't ooze a little at least. They were okay enough crisp wise though the coating kind of freely crumbed. The coating so bland that I was getting an off-note of either stale bread crumb or cardboard undertones. They are wrapped in an inner package of plastic so I don't think that off taste is the result of paper taste transfer. The cheese itself is equally bland. The cheese is also oddly unfirm, very mushy. I have never had the urge to put seasoned salt, my flavored salt or ANY salt on a mozz stick. I didn't bother getting up to do so, I had only made 3 as a light warm snack. I will finish the other four sometime, but will prepare a little bit of sauce, or in a pinch ketchup and SALT. I won't purchase again needing to doctor them up so much.

2,B0BK4JKMN2,Grocery,"Kraft Deluxe White Cheddar Easy Microwavable Macaroni and Cheese Cups (4 ct Pack, 2.39 oz Cups)",Kraft,"Not as good as the boxes. When I was younger, I loved making the boxed Kraft Mac and Cheese (orange), usually adding frozen peas to the mac when it was nearly cooked. My sisters and I could finish off a box as a snack in the afternoon, we never had it as a serious meal. I don't know that Mom and Dad ever tasted it, but we sure enjoyed the fast, easy hot snack that was fun to pick at with a fork, often directly from the pot. My family still enjoys the boxed Kraft mac and cheese, adding peas, broccoli, or kale, always finishing with garlic and pepper. We've tried other boxed mac and cheese packages and none compares, even after decades of attempts. Finding a pack of these Kraft Deluxe Easy Mac White Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese at an insanely good price, I purchased them for the kids because they like to receive individual sized servings of foods from me. The last mac and cheese cups were not good at all, made by another manufacturer. These are okay, not terrible, and they can be improved with condiments if you want to spend the time trying to improve bland and pasty mac and cheese that fills about 1/3 of the cup. For an emergency, they are acceptable if you have a microwave, as a meal of mac and cheese, we all prefer the original blue boxes over these cups and would not purchase them again even at an insanely good price.",253,10,3,0.19494764506816864,0.456910103559494,0.00571239460259676,0.021740179508924484,0.011012212373316288,0.004184886813163757,0.3054925799369812,Neutral,0.9001368880271912,0.8024884462356567,0.6033199429512024,0.9301077723503113,0.8242988586425781,0.3993498980998993,0.8769210577011108,0.9208006262779236,0.847207248210907,0.4779806435108185,0.5086895227432251,0.776781439781189,0.3419862687587738,0.8881899118423462,Taste and Flavour

Taylors' Lemon and Orange was very bland - I could not detect notes of lemon or orange. The bags had foil wrappers which probably added to the price. Taylors' Scottish Breakfast has no wrappers.

2,B0BB1XRJDD,Grocery,"Annie's Homegrown Real Aged Cheddar Microwave Mac & Cheese with Gluten Free Pasta, 2 Ct, 2.01 OZ Cups (Pack of 6)",Annie's Homegrown,"Macaroni texture is good, that's about it. First of all, some of the 12 cups I received had plastic seals which were separated from the plastic cups, so the white powder coating the macaroni spilled all over and around the 6 packages of 2 cups each, coating interior of the Annie's box. Maybe it occurred during transit, maybe it occurred while in the Amazon facility, but wherever it occurred, we didn't get to consume those cups. I did salvage the cheese packets which are separate but included in each cup. These are simpler than pie to prepare and they take only about 2 minutes in the microwave, a few seconds to stir in the cheese powder, and an additional minute or two to meld together into a single serving of gluten-free mac and cheese made by a company of which I am a fan. Unfortunately, the solid texture of the pasta doesn't make up for the rather bland taste of the finished product. It's not salty, so that's a good thing in my opinion, but it really does need additions to turn this into an enjoyable and nutritious meal. Adding precooked vegetables like broccoli, peas or carrots will be an improvement that most kids can get into, especially if they are cut into small pieces or interesting shapes.

2,B07VV7T465,Grocery,"Taylors of Harrogate Green Tea with Jasmine, 20 Count (Pack of 6)",Taylors of Harrogate,"Overall disappointing. I tend to avoid writing reviews -- particularly when I have nothing of substance to add to what are already a significant number of positive reviews, which seems generally the case with my purchases.I usually purchase either Twinings (easier to open packaging) or Bigelow (slightly stronger flavor) lemon/ginger tea in 100/120 unit orders - neither was available at a reasonable price when I last re-ordered mid-December 2020. So I was very curious to try Taylors. Sadly the experience was disappointing. Flavor was significantly weaker than either of the two competitors, but what was most vexing was the individual packaging - the scoring of the packet was faulty, frustrating attempts to open, leading to crude tears which often rips the tag; on at least one third of the tea bags I've attempted to use to date, the portions of the strings have been sewn into the bag so that they are too short to be useful. While I don't know whether this is one unfortunate defective box of tea bags, I'm not prepared spend any more money to find out otherwise.(Also curious that Amazon [not a third party seller] is now selling this item for $8.00 more than I paid for it here six weeks ago).",209,7,2,0.010224941186606884,0.10177590698003769,0.5146309733390808,0.3524230420589447,0.00731228431686759,0.00940092746168375,0.00423197727650404,Surprise,0.9867433309555054,0.960628092288971,0.8752703666687012,0.9611755013465881,0.7415003776550293,0.5943261384963989,0.915976345539093,0.9911823272705078,0.6809919476509094,0.7155640125274658,0.4885651767253876,0.1824454367160797,0.4010623097419739,0.056405358016490936,Packaging

Obviously others feel differently based on the 4 and a half stars the product has overall, but if you are looking for something closer to mayo, you might want to look elsewhere.Btw, on an odd note, the lid was VERY tight and the edges are sharp plastic, and it cut me when i opened the jar.",109,5,4,0.04840049147605896,0.8413780927658081,0.07447250932455063,0.012588714249432087,0.006204595789313316,0.002208534860983491,0.01474697794765234,Neutral,0.9918224811553955,0.8405318260192871,0.04156751558184624,0.8646477460861206,0.324278861284256,0.04630503058433533,0.36166176199913025,0.4532047212123871,0.6030707955360413,0.5615625977516174,0.17134544253349304,0.47077327966690063,0.02170049585402012,0.011770563200116158,Not as Expected

I primarily use it for smoothies, but also mix with half orange or lemon juice/half water and just pour a tsp or two in a water bottle, shake and drink (if using lemon, I add honey). MUCH better deal because it's second harvest (and you should check out nutritionally, not such a bad thing) and love the sustained, slower energy boost than I get from coffee (that takes you high than leaves you flat).

Made one pot, ended up pouring that out and then tossed the whole bag.Life is too short to suffer through a bad cup of coffee.",92,6,2,0.8025842308998108,0.14355704188346863,0.004132357891649008,0.02877528965473175,0.014734151773154736,0.003700736677274108,0.00251628365367651,Disgust,0.9502719044685364,0.8701815009117126,0.30214083194732666,0.9458256363868713,0.05303492024540901,0.18075835704803467,0.4793512225151062,0.06920268386602402,0.40908899903297424,0.08498011529445648,0.39019539952278137,0.23315735161304474,0.6733814477920532,0.01568307913839817,Not as Expected

Let me start by saying that the cheap price of ~$3 USD for the tin is a large portion of the rating. I opened it and it smells like cheap liquid smoke and nothing else, which I wasn't used to for Lapsangs. Combine this smell with a spelling error on the tin and I was convinced i got a fake, but opted to brew it anyway. It brewed to the color featured in the photos, and tasted like a very mild version of the smell. If you don't like the scent of opening a bag of cheap extra-smoky flavored jerky in your nose, you probably wont like this. The flavor, when i can taste anything at all aside from the mild smoky flavor, is even more mild. I was kind of hoping for this tea to figuratively punch me in the mouth with smoke since it was so bold and smoky in the tin, but it didn't come close. Maybe mix this with another more full-bodied tea.I've had better smoked teas for sure, but for the price, it's reminiscent enough for me.

3,B0BZJVZD95,Amazon Home,"Costa Farms Live Indoor Plant, Little Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree, Indoor House Plant, in Premium Rose Gold Decor Planter, 1-2 Feet Tall",Costa Farms,"Traumatic arrival, but bouncing back slowly with some TLC. I love this plant and when I moved into my new place a few weeks ago I decided it was time to gift myself with this new baby. I was so excited to open it and add it to the new home only to find the poor plant practically suffocating in the box. There was dirt everywhere and barely enough dirt to cover the roots that were completely removed from the nursery. A lot of leaves had shed and many began to brown. It seems that this plant has been through quite a ride with little protection. I just hope it’s as resilient to bounce back from it.Update: after a day I noticed the leaves were beginning to yellow on the top and a few more from the bottom have fallen. The plant was unable to stand without the bamboo stick so I gave it a pick-me-up by wiping its leaves with warm water and paper towel, topped off the roots with some dirt (although it appears it needs to be replanted very soon), and gave it a good drink under a grow light. It appears it’s doing a lot better.",202,9,3,0.20863206684589386,0.44964608550071716,0.027278492227196693,0.26085782051086426,0.00817510113120079,0.011348029598593712,0.03406244516372681,Neutral,0.872117280960083,0.7714294791221619,0.3331663906574249,0.12793028354644775,0.20713528990745544,0.19568127393722534,0.18013662099838257,0.05990549921989441,0.21865813434123993,0.10599074512720108,0.23585745692253113,0.1430470496416092,0.03359052166342735,0.017391376197338104,Not as Expected

Mine (the ones I have made already) had small hard pieces like nuts in it, vs. choc. chips (I spit them out, they didn't even melt) Cleaning the mug/cup is not easy or fast, takes more time to clean than to make and eatSUGGESTIONS: Use a micro safe 5-6 ounce cup max per each packet Replace water with syrup or liquor (I've used Torani's Toasted Marshmallow Syrup and Chocolate Biscotti liquor so far) - do NOT use a thick syrup like the ones for *ice cream as they will be too thick Top with ice cream, whipped cream, *sauce for ice cream, nuts, M&M’s, etc. ***check expiration date when received - it's clearly shown (amazingly the one I got is good for about 1 1/2 years, as compared with many other food and beverage items I've bought online!) Make in a micro-safe disposable cup to avoid the awful, time consuming cleanup (esp. If you're going to eat it before going to bed and don't want an impossible to clean dish when you get up in the morning!)OVERALL SUMMARY: I would recommend this product. 1) during this time (’20/’21) with the widespread Covid and the quarantines, closed stores, fears of being near other people 2) during the winter if snowed in and can't go out grocery shopping 3) for a quick sugar fix, snack, dessert, single-use packsHope this short and ‘sweet’ review is helpful to someone looking for this particular dessert mix!",331,8,2,0.1768035739660263,0.589174747467041,0.06875269114971161,0.05494386702775955,0.03157360479235649,0.05055500566959381,0.028196468949317932,Neutral,0.8678107261657715,0.10792141407728195,0.30927371978759766,0.978165328502655,0.9601181149482727,0.6505504846572876,0.947369396686554,0.7066691517829895,0.9297642707824707,0.601625382900238,0.5967288613319397,0.961780846118927,0.7233809232711792,0.972597599029541,Taste and Flavour

I’m writing this review because I feel the seller is being deceptive calling these “Kraft” brand caramels when they clearly are not.I had 2 bags of genuine Kraft caramels when these ones arrived and here are the differences I see.1). Smaller squares. Kraft ones are thicker.2). Different taste. There is something about these that just isn’t the same as the Kraft ones. It’s almost like a tapioca flavor aftertaste, or maybe vanilla. But I know the Kraft caramels never taste like that.3). Not as smooth and thick and creamy as the Kraft ones. Kraft caramels melt in your mouth into warm, thick, smooth sweet caramel but these ones get slightly gritty before dissolving.Now, having said that, are these awful? No they aren’t. They’re okay.

3,B0BRTDTGRQ,Grocery,"Marquis | Zero Sugar Yerba Mate | Caffeine With Benefits | Healthy Natural Energy Drink Alternative | Vegan & Non-GMO | Organic Plant Based Caffeine | 12 Pack, 12 fl oz cans (Variety)",Marquis,"no flavor in the lychee-peach, cant taste either flavor, results in terrible bitter experience. I have the variety pack. I bought it on sale. Glad I did, as I am not liking this all that much and I would have been more disappointed in a full price item. I have a high tolerance for unpleasant, but this actually turned me off, especially the Lychee Peach. Which is truly disappointing because that is the flavor that caught my interest. I love love love Lychee, and I figured peach would be a nice pairing. It tastes NOTHING like lychee or peach. I could not tell you what I was tasting other than spine shivering bitterness. It is almost like they didnt add any actual flavor to the bottle.I dont need sweet, I dont need a lot of flavor, but I need to be able to tell what the flavor is and I need not to drink it and cringe. I shuddered with every sip until I finally just gave up. Energy drinks can be a bit unpleasant, and some taste best super cold, and some kind of grow on me. I tend to overlook some unpleasant for the benefit of lifting the mind fog and giving me a little pep.This (the lychee peach) is so off putting that I ended up not finishing the can. I HATE WASTING food or drink. But this was so.. blegh. Maybe I can salvage it by mixing it with something. I gave the ""Super Berry"" a try, and that was much better--not great, but it is palatable. I can drink that. It has a berry flavor. I am very familiar with all ingredients and flavors here, so I know what to expect. I am hoping the yuzu (a citrus flavor) is good, and I have high hoped for the mango ginger. But I wont know for a couple more days. I haven't worked through the other 2 flavors yet. So far it is 50-50. Perhaps I will update.I like that it has 100 mg of caffeine. Not too much. I have had some caffeinated drinks that are 200+ mg, and that is too much for me since I already drink coffee. I like an energy drink to top me off, for when I want something cold and bubbly, and for times I am about to start a chore or do a work out that will benefit from the added ""motivation"". I dont need a lot of caffeine, just usually a little bump. So this having 100 mg and being listed on the front of the bottle is a positive about this product.Also has some vitamin C and some B vitamins.RATING: I am going with middle of road rating of 3. I think it is ""OK"", and that is only because at least one flavor of the 4 has been good. The lychee peach is terribad (1 star). Super berry is decent (4 stars).I like what they are trying to do here. I have had similar products (where the ingredients are much healthier than other energy drinks), but truly this has been the most disappointing. I doubt it would ever be a repurchase unless one of the flavors truly make me feel good and tastes good.",543,36,2,0.17515306174755096,0.08919446915388107,0.03918859735131264,0.507697582244873,0.011462212540209293,0.16775870323181152,0.009545464999973774,Sadness,0.990011990070343,0.9437060356140137,0.8893276453018188,0.977080762386322,0.653376042842865,0.5918830037117004,0.8951972126960754,0.9193015694618225,0.36990809440612793,0.5280185341835022,0.8170281648635864,0.3904200494289398,0.2719215750694275,0.03654458746314049,Not as Expected

3,B074H64QMY,Grocery,"365 by Whole Foods Market, Ripe Green Pitted Olives, 6 Ounce",365 by Whole Foods Market,"Not as good as the major brand. Firstly, from some of the reviews it seems like people don't know their olive varieties. Green ripe olives are normally a bit buttery, a bit oily (very much like good EVOO) and firm. These are not the briney vinegary type (which I also love) I am an olive fan, all types of olives.This particular type was banned in US for quite awhile because of its freckles (google) when they came back I no longer saw the ""california"" brand on the shelves but ""pearls"". Pearls were just fine. I actually picked up a case online once and finished them off pretty quickly (I love olives).With my WF order I thought I would see what they had and picked up a few cans of 365. A bit disappointed when I tried for the first time last night. They seemed about a size smaller than the pearls and unfortunately many of them were mushy. Most of them actually. Taste is still good but the mushiness left me wanting and considering price, I would rather order the pearls instead if only I could get them without ordering by the case. My local market stopped carrying this variety and online is my only option.",207,12,2,0.21751144528388977,0.61586594581604,0.03421837091445923,0.10857152938842773,0.008270591497421265,0.0040100640617311,0.011551993899047375,Neutral,0.9899242520332336,0.42996498942375183,0.4873126447200775,0.8196825981140137,0.7083314061164856,0.200592041015625,0.8334057331085205,0.6008749604225159,0.22952960431575775,0.30381283164024353,0.39311420917510986,0.43197718262672424,0.22461947798728943,0.22245000302791595,Not as Expected

Bought these on fresh I actually went for the organic ones because hey I supposed they would be better quality. I tend to have problems when I buy on fresh specially with produce because they always bring the produce that is almost past due or in bad condition. As for the food sometimes they bring in opened things or sometimes cans that are in bad condition too but honestly I did not think I would have a problem with these as well. In fact in the picture there are 5 tomatoes and the ones that arrived were only 3, to this point I was a lil upset but whatever, I opened them as soon as they arrived and realized that one of them had mold on it! I really don't tend to care too much but given I got less than what I expected and that at least one of them was in bad condition I would not buy these again maybe, or just a warning they do this a lot where they put one bad fruit or veggies in between the others so they go bad faster and honestly they should check this more! It has happened way too often specially when I buy on fresh and they always have mold on them specially vegetables or fruits and it's always one of them or when they come in bags I don't know why they do this but I assume it's so we are forced to buy more just not happy overall with this happening.",263,7,2,0.07150450348854065,0.22134502232074738,0.572931170463562,0.04560723155736923,0.07674426585435867,0.006181990262120962,0.005685874726623297,Surprise,0.993729293346405,0.7881789207458496,0.37436848878860474,0.6975767016410828,0.6355404853820801,0.9787958860397339,0.7471202611923218,0.39417779445648193,0.9115922451019287,0.6994462609291077,0.6979455351829529,0.60373854637146,0.5153579711914062,0.19752520322799683,Not as Expected

Part of the reason I tried this tea is because one reviewer said he's very much a fan of this kind of tea and that Numi does a good job with the flavor. Since I'm a fan of Numi and chocolate, I bought & tried it. Sadly, I think it's an acquired taste, and I don't care for it. To me, the taste is like tree bark mixed with bitter dark chocolate, and I don't care for it. I also read that this type of tea contains caffeine, so I think I'll pass on ordering more. Back to rooibos, and I will try the mint next time.Additional note: I've now tried this over ice with 1 packet of sweetener, and I like it very much this way. I also drink it with lunch, so the caffine isn't a problem. This way, I'll use up the box, & none will go to waste. I'm enjoying the tea this way very much, and I think it will also be good in hot weather, so I'll continue to purchase it.

UPDATE: most recent order had only about 2 oz of tofu, still in pieces far too large for a salad.---This isn't bad. The tofu pieces are far too large, and I cut them in half. Plan to eat this within one day of receiving it though. I have ordered this a number of times, and twice I have received one which expired on the day it was delivered. Usually it is a day or two out, max. This does not keep well in the fridge, as the shelf life is extremely short. If I buy one, I now know I have to eat it within 24 hours or so. Once you get past this, it's pretty tasty. Bit of an identity confusion issue though in terms of the recipe: Vietnamese style noodle salad with thin vermicelli-style noodles (may be either egg or rice noodles, seems to randomly vary--depends on the day, apparently), shredded lettuce, carrots and daikon, a Thai satay dressing, and Chinese-style sesame snaps for crunch.

As I ate it by the forkful, I thought of how I could taste the tomato, the olive oil and the basil, each individually. There was not a hint of sweetness. Unfortunately, within minutes of finishing the meal, my digestive system revolted, an experience that is unnatural for me. This is quite a disappointment because I'd placed an order for the alternate assortment of three varieties which I intended to include in holiday gifts I'm assembling.

I've been purchasing the YumEarth lollipops for more than a decade because they are so tasty and easy to slip into a pocket or bag and always have them on hand to enjoy and share but this is not the way I'd recommend purchasing them. Alternatively, I'd recommend purchasing the 5-pound assortment bag to get all of the flavors, keep them in an airtight container, and use a smaller container for a couple dozen at a time. You could even have the kids decorate one that's easy to open. If you don't need that many lollipops, they are also available in smaller sized bags of around 3 ounces, I believe, so you can get a half dozen of those and keep them fresh until you replenish your candy jar or jug.

I didn't look at the nutrition label beforehand surprisingly and I was under the impression it was really healthy. The front of the bag boasts it's only 39 calories per cup, no trans fat, etc. It does taste great. Maybe not as good as some of the super butter movie style popcorns out there but much better than the low-fat, 94% fat free, type of popcorns out there. So I'm thinking this is a great popcorn! I read the ingredients and it's just popcorn, oil and salt and I thought that was nice it didn't have a bunch of chemicals and preservatives or dairy. But then I finally read the nutrition label. The ""serving size"" is 4 c (pretty generous but i think standard popcorn serving size) and it has 10 grams of fat! That's quite a lot for something that bills itself as being so good for you and skinny. I still eat it, because it is really good but I think they are a bit misleading with the packaging and would encourage those to read the nutritional information and keep that in mind when trying it. That said, this is a great way to order it on amazon as it's a good price and I can just add a bad onto a regular order.",265,13,4,0.0048275054432451725,0.1530376523733139,0.6296506524085999,0.0049616131000220776,0.00667980220168829,0.00237279268912971,0.19846996665000916,Surprise,0.990094006061554,0.42604610323905945,0.4173516035079956,0.7544652223587036,0.8024600148200989,0.6836191415786743,0.8288727402687073,0.9741293787956238,0.7897627949714661,0.6238530278205872,0.8338620662689209,0.7941049337387085,0.20664334297180176,0.6888859868049622,Not as Expected

I ordered a case of Tasty Brand Organic Cereal Bars in the Pumpkin Pie flavor. The following week I accidentally ordered a second case when I placed another amazon.com order, and so I ended up with quite a few bars! This would have been no problem at all had I loved them as much as I had hoped I might. But they are actually kind of dry- like, without a glass of milk, I don't give them to my daughter in case she might choke! And though there is a clear little picture of bananas alongside a pumpkin on the front of the box, I only went with the assumption that they would taste like pumpkin pie.

3,B086RL21LN,Grocery,"Heinz No Salt Tomato Ketchup, 14 Ounce -- 6 per case.",Heinz,"Bitter ketchup likely due to storage. Since I was a young person, Heinz Tomato Ketchup was the ketchup of choice in our family. Now I must confess that I am more a mustard fan and user than a ketchup or mayonnaise loving person, so a single bottle usually lasts a long time unless I'm making barbeque sauce out of it. I made this purchase because it's Heinz, it had no added sugar, it was offered at a very good price and I intended to share with my family members and friends who are also avoiding high fructose corn syrup and had already tried this product. The case of 6 looked perfect upon arrival but the first bottle ketchup did not taste good. The consistency was runny and the flavor was bitter. I removed the seal on a second bottle and the ketchup tasted the same. I then made contact with Kraft Foods, the manufacturer of Heinz products, and they responded very quickly. Because of the communicative customer service representative, I'm rating this as an average product and once I purchase it in a brick and mortar store, should I find it to be a better product, I'll up the rating. I'll still keep purchasing the Hot and Spicy Heinz Ketchup because it's so tasty that I often use in place of hot sauce and that says a lot.",228,10,2,0.43779659271240234,0.3609699010848999,0.0068266382440924644,0.028894636780023575,0.15842846035957336,0.0029407439287751913,0.004142990801483393,Disgust,0.6363802552223206,0.5766676664352417,0.3290718197822571,0.6912017464637756,0.1026650220155716,0.15270081162452698,0.8059181571006775,0.25603169202804565,0.5553926229476929,0.1250271201133728,0.3393915891647339,0.724500834941864,0.2775798439979553,0.07600786536931992,Price

3,B001EQ57U2,Grocery,"Knorr Ultimate Clam Base, 16-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)",Knorr,"Short of the Mark! The main reason I buy this type of product is because I know how hard it is to make your own. Requires a nice investment of time and money to locate, in this case the clams mostly, and sacrifice all that goodness into turning a bunch of clams into a flavorful, authentic clam base. I truly love a clam broth, a clam chowder, a pasta with clams sauce, etc. I found out that clam is as good as, let's say, fish stock. Or seafood stock, for when is all said and done a great clam base can turn a seafood chowder into a crowd pleaser. Basically one will get what they put in it, simple as that. I wanted to like Knorr Ultimate Clam Base, 16-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2) for it offered a nice quantity for the money so I took the plunge. The one I have been using these past years is Minor's Clam Base, which I confess right here and now is the one I like the best.I bought a fish bullion in powder form, a huge can that in the first try it reminded me very fast that somethings can not be duplicated without the really good ingredients. The same thing happened with this product. Much better than the powder fish base, also from Knorr's?, for it does have more natural flavors than the more chemically oriented powder (I did not like it very much and now, I am wondering, how it it going to be consumed excepting in tiny amounts) and if used in moderation it does impart the culinary creations with that precise clam flavor that can make most seafood dishes very appealing. Note I said in moderate amounts because if I add too much its sodium content will overpower any culinary endeavor to the point that it might get rejected, and that is always an embaressment to the wannabee cook. I learned to measure this product carefully. In one case I added a little too much and was able to increase all the other ingredients until they somehow meshed together, resulting in a very edible white sauce with shrimp, scallops and fish over linguini with a touch of parmesan cheese. Knorr Ultimate Clam Base is decent but not as great as Minor's, but of course Minor's must also be used carefully so as not too overpower or under power the creation. Got 2 for under $20 and that is a good thing. Will use it until is gone but I will go back to Minor's Clam Base, because even though is more expensive it appears more naturally tasting, like if it had a higher concentration of clams than the competition so far. Every chef knows that a good base is almost a must, be that chicken, beef, even turkey, clam, fish and seafood form. They add a distinctive quality that is going to be hard to beat if all the other ingredients and the cooking is done right. 3.5 Stars for sure but short of the mark to be considered the best!PS: Today is 2-2-2012. After having used this product repeatedly because I received two tubs, I have to say that it is much better than what I initially had thought. It works very well and the flavor adds body and taste to most seafood creations. Live and Learn, I guess, I should have waited longer because definitely my appreciation for this item has increased.

3,B002GOYT3M,Grocery,"Tandoor Chef Chicken Curry with Seasoned Basmati Rice, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",Tandoor Chef,"Ok, but degraded in quality. The reason I take a couple of stars off this meal is that this is not a chicken curry, let alone curried chicken. This is pieces of pre-cooked cubed deboned compressed chicken, tossed into a curry sauce at the last moment before packaging and freezing. The chicken is therefore not infused with spice, and is also dry and tasteless. I suspect the chicken is pre-cooked for inclusion into a wide variety of packaged foods, probably across several companies. Which is all a bit sad. The curry sauce is pretty good as is the rice. And no, you don't get much for the money: the portions are small and expensive. But, hey, it's better than most microwavable meals available in the USA.

The peanuts which are overwhelmingly the majority of the 56 ounces are good, as can be expected by Planters peanuts, but the other nuts are average at best. Unfortunately, some are rancid despite having a lengthy best by date imprinted on the can. Freshly opened with the heavy foil seal peeled back only halfway on our gently shaken can, we were surprised to note that there was no visibly heavy salt coating the nuts. Following the initial taste, came a brief disappointment, but as with any nut in this house, we ate them anyway. (Double entendre intended.) Some of the nuts were soft in texture and the mix, in general, benefitted from the peanuts, so perhaps that is why Planters includes very close to 50% in the mix. I purchased this giant can at a very good price but will not repurchase them even if they are on sale again. There are simply too many other great nuts available and it's quite easy to put together a mix in a recycled can or jar. I store all nuts in the refrigerator to preserve freshness and remind us that they exist.

3,B0932KM465,Grocery,"Darjeeling Tea - Organic - Loose Leaf - Bulk - Non GMO - 96 Servings, 8 oz",Golden Moon Tea,"Easing into Darjeeling on a sweeter note - Not bad at all. For the taste, I do find the price a bit high. Consider the 87 single estates of Darjeeling and then how many vendors blend their own at lower grades along with the different flush (season), there can be a lot of general Darjeeling. That makes it confusing. Anyone who wants to get into the better ones, you look for the single estates. When it's labeled Darjeeling, it's anyone's guess. Too often, they don't ever mention the tasting notes. It's good when they do.This is what I like about this brand. It does have that classic muscatel note that's dominant in most Darjeeling teas. Not all of them have that note. Depends on the flush. What makes this one nice is it does have a light, sweet taste at the end. For anyone new to Darjeeling and they want an easier transition to the more prominent muscatel note, this would be the one.Much of the time, Darjeeling has the Earthy, grassy, plant notes. Some are more floral and some are fruity. Often times, when they state almond, peach, muscatel and such, they refer to the skin, not the actual fruit or nut. The taste is more bitter.Those into the Darjeeling have a darker, more Earthy palate. Unless it's a single estate that you're familiar with, majority are going to have heavier tasting notes.If you like the aroma of Lavender, the Namring single est. offers that. For more almond note, Selim Hill single est.This does have more taste than a certain brand sold on here in a blue bag. It doesn't taste as basic. There's a little more to this one that makes it enjoyable to drink all day. For many, this is a good tea. It's not bad at all.So far between the Ceylon and this, it has been pleasant tea. For the quality of it and taste, the price is higher than it should be. That's having a lot of experience with tea.It's much better than Lipton of course. But not the same as a single estate and the quality isn't as high as it could be for the price.For some who tried a thousand teas, not sure that's valid. There are hundreds for sure. Anyone who as tried a lot of teas knows that a lot of teas overlap and it's a mix of grades and other teas to be a diff tea product, but not a whole entire type of tea bush.87 Darjeeling estates. Break that into 3 seasons. Then break it into grades from how finely cut to whole leaves to how fresh it is to barely having any taste. 87 diff tea bushes is that. It breaks into the 3 seasons then you have 261 to choose from, but still it's 87 estates that have their own unique taste. Take the 1st or 2nd flush to blend, that's what you get. Blends.Over a thousand blends from hundreds of different teas, yes. Thousands of tea as if there are that many different bushes, no. 87 diff tea bushes in the Darjeeling region alone can produce hundreds of blends. Anyone who has tried thousands of teas chances are only had hundreds.Even then, no reason to review it as if this is to be the site for the top 100 teas of the world. You want the best teas, it's not sold in this site. Anyone who is really into teas would know that. If they're going to grade it in such a way as if every tea connoisseur thinks that way, then 99% of the teas sold on this site would be a 1 star to folks like that.For all those who want a good tea to enjoy without it being on the same level as the ones sold in most chain stores, this is good. Just the price isn't so good. If the price was much lower, I think this would be a daily staple to have for many.The Idulgashinna single estate Ceylon sold on here under Irish, English breakfast are good, sturdy teas for a good price. You have to find that marked on the bag. Technically it's not Irish or English blend. Single estates are not blends. That's why it's called single estate. If you blend them, you can't call them single estate.The brand is good on its own. It would taste better blended with other teas for those who know how to blend. It's a good all day, any day tea. Not at the level to be addictive.",756,47,4,0.024736134335398674,0.9334107041358948,0.008429369889199734,0.00940975546836853,0.004435269627720118,0.0019116749754175544,0.017667066305875778,Neutral,0.8069202303886414,0.6573010683059692,0.7657638788223267,0.94306480884552,0.8980093598365784,0.8421443700790405,0.9107521176338196,0.5330807566642761,0.9390291571617126,0.8933836817741394,0.8047523498535156,0.779007613658905,0.689456582069397,0.9359419941902161,Taste and Flavour

I normally dont care, but since I bought this on the warehouse, I wanted to check to see how far out the best by or expiration is.

I may try it again, since other reviews were positive.",108,5,2,0.09662161767482758,0.5305626392364502,0.03752700611948967,0.03836731240153313,0.00817764364182949,0.0036270287819206715,0.2851167619228363,Neutral,0.9976508617401123,0.6937937140464783,0.6473650932312012,0.9709153771400452,0.4295145869255066,0.7937309145927429,0.6146701574325562,0.44258949160575867,0.6016027331352234,0.31745147705078125,0.7249597311019897,0.8511415719985962,0.2379947304725647,0.0646519735455513,Not as Expected

Gritty. Hint of lemon. Best in smoothies. Mediocre for toast. NO guac. People are scoffing at ""freeze dried"", This isn't freeze dried. It is low temp dried.OK, so this isn't quite for me, but it isnt ""bad"". It's just avocado and lemon. Depending on what you are hoping to use it for, your expectation may be met or may fall short. Direct from bag, it is gritty with a mix of yellow and dark green. Do a 1:1 ratio of water and avocado powder. Well, actually it is granular, not at all powder like. Stir for a couple of minutes. I even let it sit. Remained gritty. Maybe a small mixer would help. The grit is going to be the turn off factor for a lot of people who want to use this beyond smoothies.Taste is OK. Very mild avocado taste with hint of lemon. Kinda would prefer no lemon. I think that makes this taste off, especially depending on what it is being use in. Fine if using it in smoothies. Texture is probably best for smoothies, but I was hoping to use it as a topper for toast or coconut basmati rice.I am finding that avocados in store have been sub par. I dont know.. was just hoping for something better here. No bad, but not what I want. Again, I think it is fine for the nutrition and use it in smoothies. Can try it in other applications, just know that it wont quite make the same results. Because of the GRIT.I dont think it is gross; I am not that dramatic. I'll use it up, but it likely wont be a repurchase. I will look for dehydrated or freeze dried avocado powder that can be reconstituted into a non gritty paste.If this was smooth, and had less of a lemon taste (I love lemon by the way), I would like it more.

Yes, Jack Link's... every time you hear about beef jerky, this name automatically comes to mind if you're in the United States. But in reality, it's only average in taste for the price. It's not super expensive and it's not super cheap, but for this price, there are some better ones that have better flavor and less moisture content. Yes, the more dry beef jerky is, the more beef they need to use to get the same weight, and this is relatively high on the moisture content.

Flavor wise, it's pretty mild, but I'm not going to judge if you've grown up on the taste and want something consistent.",135,7,3,0.033133428543806076,0.9134697914123535,0.023383084684610367,0.005949310027062893,0.005155290011316538,0.0010690991766750813,0.017839983105659485,Neutral,0.9191915988922119,0.017464112490415573,0.007747183553874493,0.9801494479179382,0.4743412435054779,0.035058338195085526,0.941294252872467,0.5653918385505676,0.6775528788566589,0.01940407231450081,0.10382910072803497,0.6435620784759521,0.23654699325561523,0.5696607828140259,Taste and Flavour
3,B0064KU9B0,Grocery,Planters Dry Roasted Salted Macadamias (6.25 oz Jar),Planters,"Risky purchase, the nuts vary from great to barely edible. I purchased a jar of the Planters Macadamia nuts and thought they were quite the tasty nuts in a small, easy to open and close plastic container which would prevent the risk of overindulgence. Because they were not very salty and each nut in the jar was crisp and enjoyable, I purchased another four jars over a period of a couple of several days as the price was reduced. Unfortunately, after the first jar, the others have been disappointing. The nut sizes range from tiny to robust, the textures vary from nut to nut, some are so dark that I wonder about whether they should even be consumed. The jar I opened yesterday ended up as part of a cookie batch which turned out pretty good but they were not as great as usual. It seems that unlike the first jar we received, the remaining jars will not be the tasty nuts we enjoyed with a cocktail.",167,7,3,0.08439090102910995,0.7206841111183167,0.03250211477279663,0.10287673026323318,0.004910567309707403,0.00640459917485714,0.04823097959160805,Neutral,0.9588684439659119,0.5482006669044495,0.7111604809761047,0.9617443680763245,0.828616201877594,0.6157710552215576,0.8559833765029907,0.5935757160186768,0.7046669125556946,0.34072595834732056,0.4710421562194824,0.21046794950962067,0.20732389390468597,0.3598839342594147,Taste and Flavour

Canned potatoes are convenient.INGREDIENTS/CALORIES - VERY few ingredients, which is a plus, plus low in calories. You can eat a can of these for less than 200 calories.PRICE : Hard to beat as I got for about a buck a can.TASTE - Taste is fine. Easy to nuke to hit up and add whatever ingredients. Already diced and cooked, so that was nice.NOW FOR THE ONE BIG CON: MANY of the cans were dented, I mean dented as in you don't want to chance eating them.

I've always liked Hostess products -- I'm old enough to remember when Twinkies were filled with banana cream -- and they're not often easy to find in my local supermarket.Amazon to the rescue! One of my all-time favorites, Zingers and at a decent price, too.Unfortunately, the expiration date was 2 days before my delivery date. Received 1/24; expiration date 1/22. Yes, I know they will keep beyond that date, but they were already stale, somewhat dry, and the icing was hard as a rock. Really, someone needs to be keeping track of expiration dates before shipping product that will expire before it reaches the customer. I still like Zingers, and I stashed them in the freezer to try to prevent further product deterioration, but I shouldn't have to do that.That said, they're as I remember (except for the stale part): nice chocolatey cake, creamy filling, thick layer of chocolate icing. What's not to love?This is the 4th Hostess product I've ordered from Amazon (sold by was Amazon, not a 3rd party seller) that had this problem of the expiration date within days of receipt.

If you have more than one dog, use it on all servings for all the dogs in the house. Take it easy: large quantities of sodium are no better for your dog than they are for you. As it passes through a dog's digestive tract, MSG turns into a bitter-tasting chemical that dogs find repellent.

A lot depends upon your expectations and personal preferences, but I would have liked to have a little more syrup added to the sodas for a stronger flavor.",74,6,3,0.034921612590551376,0.7591663002967834,0.048825062811374664,0.05871985852718353,0.005212096031755209,0.0033295832108706236,0.08982548117637634,Neutral,0.9391682147979736,0.3474429249763489,0.4250815212726593,0.9817699193954468,0.5492295026779175,0.5777226090431213,0.5559492111206055,0.3681044578552246,0.8438140749931335,0.4848509132862091,0.48587217926979065,0.4369845688343048,0.22576867043972015,0.4736216962337494,Taste and Flavour

I liked the idea that this came in a squeeze plastic bottle rather than the Coco Lopez that’s in a can. I thought it would taste the same and easier to use. Unfortunately this one didn’t have much taste and seemed like it was watered down. On a positive note this coconut cream does have an expiration date on them unlike the Coco Lopez. I found that all the coconut creams need to be refrigerated after opening and then kept in it after using. This tends to make it too thick to pour with the Coco Lopez (that states to use it at room temperature) but not with this brand. It’s sort of a toss up as to which one is better but IMO I’d rather use the other cream and pour the contents of the can into a squeeze bottle before refrigerating!",152,8,3,0.0691697746515274,0.829191267490387,0.03713490813970566,0.02246486395597458,0.015245513990521431,0.0029618116095662117,0.02383190579712391,Neutral,0.987522304058075,0.6429691910743713,0.2761441767215729,0.9595526456832886,0.33561351895332336,0.40707167983055115,0.5822097063064575,0.8580570220947266,0.7548527717590332,0.2608165144920349,0.38500770926475525,0.6141040325164795,0.9470565915107727,0.582371711730957,Not as Expected

3,B000YVBP36,Grocery,"Knorr Fish Bouillion Mix, 32-Ounce Canister",Knorr,"Not Really... Every wannabee cook knows that to make an above average culinary creation 3 things are necessary: Talent and creativity, a good recipe, and most important, great ingredients. If those 3 are in place then the results will be nothing short of outstanding every single time.I have been in love with seafood since a toddler when a mini wave took me up to sea and I was rescued by an aging mermaid. I love all things that come from the sea excepting in sushi form, perhaps some of the sea life in raw form does not agree with my palate. I love making seafood dishes, from soups to main entrees. Soups are my biggest weakness for I use to go to a pier where the seafood would arrive early in the morning hours and right then and there a hot pot with water will be waiting to be filled up with all manners of the daily catch. Mussels, fish heads, shell fish, pieces of fish, oysters, octopus, shrimp, etc etc. These selections would be the leftovers, the ones that did not command a sizable market price, they would end in their own version of the french bouillabaisse, with herbs and spices and the phosphorus of the fish heads, in no time the broth would be bursting with natural flavor right from the ocean. Add some lemon (lime here for the lemon in US is not as pungent), a little home made salsa with onions, chilies and tomatoes, and if you were courageous enough extra heat. By the time you would finish this powerful concoction all the phosphorus of the seafood would command to find the nearest hammock and snore for a couple of hours only to wake up feeling like a million dollars.Enter Knorr Fish Boullion Mix, 32 Ounce Canister: yes, somewhere in its contents there is some vague taste of fish, but it certainly does not taste natural. It seems to be a little on the smoky side, it definitely has its own particular taste but it is way off from an above average fish stock. I have been using Minor's Clam Base (because is the cheapest in price and imparts a delicious total flavor to dishes) and this time I was caught on the curiosity of purchasing this powder form bouillon. I loved the quantity and the powder form mystified me, what if it works as good as what I had been using? Of course is much more affordable than the clam base I am talking about (that one must be refrigerated and it is semi solid but it does have a truly clam smell) so I bought it and immediately tried it on a seafood chowder cilantro based. A very simple soup that includes hulled barley, onions finely chopped, fresh corn, small diced potatoes and fresh chilies properly sauteed with fresh garlic and olive oil and then blended with the cilantro and a couple of cans of quality diced tomatoes, preferably the ones with a little herbs thrown in. Who am I kidding? The ones they sell at Costco! This soup replaces the hard task of making your own fish stock which requires good fish heads with very clear eyes and all the other ingredients. Too much work for a wannabee cook these days but if done right it is every bit as good as anything you can eat these days. Throw some scallops, different fish, clams (if you can find plump ones), two or three fillets of mahi mahi, large shrimp, etc. But in the end, really, if the broth is good that is all a person would need to enjoy a hot cup or two of fish broth.This one does not quite reach the levels of goodness I am referring to. It does the job but the final product lacks that essence of the sea, it is a little too processed?Please do not get me wrong. I use the Knorr Chicken Powder and it works for me, a great value, so perhaps some people are more than satisfied with this product as well. I give it 3 Stars but that is it and I realize I am deviating from all the other 5 Star ratings, but the thing is, when you had the chance to try a superior product this one just can not compete. My chowder ended tasting okey but not spectacularly good and that hurts for I threw in a whole lot of seafood. Happy to have Albertsons sell this little packages of $1 each that allows for variety even though it is not the best of the catch they do offer bay scallops, different fishes, even shrimp and calamari, so it is not a bad deal. 3 Stars.",788,28,3,0.031070787459611893,0.8359735012054443,0.053253423422575,0.00465724803507328,0.008920881897211075,0.004111443646252155,0.06201266497373581,Neutral,0.7214111685752869,0.6944000720977783,0.5448715686798096,0.7305954694747925,0.6577023863792419,0.5212944149971008,0.6168203353881836,0.5898545980453491,0.6466820240020752,0.5005260109901428,0.7594321966171265,0.4993460178375244,0.34554722905158997,0.252471387386322,Ingredients

Well, I ordered three tins of smoked paprika, one each of sweet, bittersweet and hot.I love the smokiness and flavor it imparts to dishes, and wanted to try some otherstrengths.We received the cans today. It was well-packaged and everything arrived in great shape.The seller was also quick to ship the order out. I have no problems at all with the seller.One tin expires in 2012, and the other two are 2013, so guess I got an older tin of one strength.This review is for the MILD (or sweet) paprika from Chiquilin.What a disappointment!This has NO smoky aroma at all, despite it supposedly being a smoked product.I have not cooked with it yet, but I surely hope that it adds more flavor than it does aroma.Otherwise, I could have just bought plain paprika in the grocery store for a lot less.(The actual smoky paprika ([[ASIN:B000NO943C Smoked Paprika Tin]]) DOES have a wonderful smoky aroma and was what I expected from all the versions.)I read a lot of different information about the brands, and while this was not my #1 choice on brands,it was affordable and the seller did combined shipping, which was why I chose it. I guess you get whatyou pay for? I was under the assumption that all of the Spanish paprikas were smoked paprikas, and you just gotdifferent strengths of the roast. This does not seem to be the case with this brand.We are going to keep the mild/sweet and the smoked, but returning the hot without opening it.I hope it tastes better than it smells. I am admittedly disappointed in the aromatic qualities(or lack of them) of this particular mild paprika. You can probably do better with another brand.",301,12,2,0.01473594643175602,0.25167199969291687,0.17019544541835785,0.5012899041175842,0.008221259340643883,0.0029011520091444254,0.05098428577184677,Sadness,0.9944242238998413,0.3986714482307434,0.8306734561920166,0.960106372833252,0.8192140460014343,0.2879696190357208,0.596648097038269,0.9892758131027222,0.6824621558189392,0.7689539194107056,0.16083116829395294,0.5481976866722107,0.5952284932136536,0.07937879860401154,Not as Expected

4,B0778TQKH3,Grocery,Fazer Marianne Chocolate Filled Mint Candies Imported From Finland 7.76oz(220g),Fazer,"Chocolate with an minty shell. I bought these after someone mentioned it was their favorite European candy. It sounded good - a thin minty shell wrapped around good chocolate - so I figured I'd give it a try. Personally, I could go either way on them - I'd prefer the shell was slightly thinner so I could chew it right up and get both textures and flavors at once. However, if you let it sit in the mouth for a bit, it gets to that state in about 90 seconds, so not a deal breaker. The mint is decent quality, about a standard sugary peppermint.

December 2022 I tried to re-order but was surprised to see that the price has doubled to $19.99. In order to get the same July price, I had to order two boxes of 50 bags that are: (1) not individually packaged, (2) two bags are attached to each other so you do have to rip them a part which is no big deal, (3) these bags are missing the string on each to easily remove the teabag from scalding water in tea cup; (4) the box has no inner wax paper lining to keep the tea from drying out. Disappointing. With what’s going on in the world today with supply chain issues and all, I can understand a price increase but double?!

My local Asian grocery store sells this same brand of ""organic"" udon noodles for about the same price as Amazon (except that they only make you buy one pack at a time). They also sell non-organic udon noodles that look and taste about the same for less than half the price. Is the ""organic"" worth the extra money? You have to decide for yourself.Udon is a great general purpose noodle. For a quick cheap tasty bowl of noodle soup, just boil some udon noodles and add some miso soup paste and vegetables. One 3 ounce bundle of dry noodles conveniently makes a nice serving of cooked noodles. A bowl of soup like this takes about the same amount of time to cook as instant ramen, but since the udon noodles are not full of salt and oil, they are a lot healthier for you. Yes, udon does cost a little more than instant ramen, but you can save money by going with the non-organic noodles, and they are still much healthier than instant ramen.You can also stir-fry the noodles or make them into a salad.

4,B082HS6FVL,Grocery,"EDGE Natural Artesian Water - Fiji Pure Drinking Water - Natural Artesian Water From Fiji - Bottled Nature Water â€“ 20.28 Fl Oz, (Pack of 24)",Edge,"This does not taste like Fiji water. It is a product of Fiji, and artesian water, but it has the taste of minerals in it, as Figi water does not. It's quite different. It also costs less, which is a good thing. The only other negative is that the bottles are very very hard to open. The plastic is thin, so in holding tight to the bottle, you apply pressure to keep it closed, and even with a nifty little grip-tight (thanks, Amazon!), it is tough to open. Other than that, it's water.I have now figured out how to open it. Run a sharp knife along the perforation on the cap. Snaps it right open, easy peasy.However, the plastic being so thin means you may also get a case with some bottle's tops bent over and rammed back towards the bottle. The best procedure I've found there is to take a sharp knife and ram the tip into the bottle and decant it. If you are lucky, you'll find a spot where the water isn't pressing against the plastic, eager to spurt out.",184,11,3,0.15937326848506927,0.7846792936325073,0.018429433926939964,0.012918476946651936,0.01598375104367733,0.0048330193385481834,0.003782678861171007,Neutral,0.6640382409095764,0.4597753584384918,0.1536579132080078,0.828977108001709,0.44976305961608887,0.3787896931171417,0.5022904872894287,0.4064331650733948,0.6744033098220825,0.3039344549179077,0.38452649116516113,0.6227728128433228,0.12928374111652374,0.489422082901001,Taste and Flavour

So I'm not a big fan of these, but it's mostly just a matter of taste. These are sweeter than the apricots I'm used to, specifically California sun-dried apricots, which tend to be tart. They are half-way between apricots and Turkish figs, in flavor. Now I don't particularly like figs, so obviously these aren't for me. But if you like figs but aren't in love with the texture, or find them a bit much, this may be a decent compromise.Freshness and texture are both solid - nice and fibrous but not so consistent as the more traditional dried apricots can sometimes be. Two or three is sufficient for a single snack.So I wouldn't buy them again, but would probably recommend trying once, if the above appeals to you.",139,7,3,0.0765354260802269,0.6433571577072144,0.005293454043567181,0.013489723205566406,0.006588130723685026,0.0022630798630416393,0.25247299671173096,Neutral,0.9193621277809143,0.48841625452041626,0.4374033510684967,0.9801189303398132,0.3004230558872223,0.9107282757759094,0.5412583947181702,0.5872504115104675,0.8332753777503967,0.4362482726573944,0.5631425380706787,0.5555351376533508,0.3435395658016205,0.6737724542617798,Taste and Flavour

None of the six bags we received in our box include clusters of any kind, but rather grains of oats and everything else that is included in the fruit and nut blend. Having this in small doses such as in a little cup for a snack, a topping for yogurt, ice cream, or mixed into plain cooked oatmeal, it is okay but sometimes you only get the oats and a residual fruit or nut bit. It's not granola that we select for pouring in a bowl with some milk. We're at the point of saving the majority of oats in a jar in the refrigerator for use in bread dough because the texture when it's free of the fruit or nuts is unappealing. It is not a winner in this household but it's not so bad that it won't eventually be consumed.EDIT: I've raised my rating because by transferring the bag contents into a jar, we have discovered that you can shake it before consuming and get a better mix of the blended ingredients. The lack of overpowering sweetness also is a definite positive. It's been growing on me and I personally now rather like the granola a lot with milk, either cow or almond.

I purchased these once they came out in the store, in the dark version because I generally loved darker pretzels and chips. I was not impressed as they were TOO dark. It made them bitter rather than more flavorful. I looked for the regular version in the store but they were always sold out so when I saw them online I threw two in the cart. I liked them better than the dark ones. Warning: they are very hard . Good teeth, much care needed eating them. One of my favorite low calorie treats is a hard pretzel or two dunked in flavored seltzer (orange is good) or a diet root beer. Had nothing for dunking but did managed to out away the two bags within a week or so. They are good, just the right amount of salt and not terribly pricey.

After receiving two five lbs bags of DARK CHOCOLATE covered raisins, with labels which say milk chocolate covered, I have come to the conclusion that the supplier doesn't really have any milk chocolate covered raisins, and got a good deal on some mislabeled stock. Having said that, I must admit that the DARK CHOCOLATE covered raisins I received in the milk chocolate covered raisins bag were delicious and of top quality. For that reason, I give them a Four Star Rating. I understand about the heat of Summer in the South, so the fact that the bag arrived with most of the raisins floating on top of the DARK CHOCOLATE syrup in the bottom of the bag was to be expected, I suppose. The shippers attempt at preventing this by insulating the bag and including a small freezer gel pack was futile, of course, since they sat in the mail box in the sun all day. I threw them in the freezer after rolling them around in the bag a bit, and later cut them into chunks to eat.

I've been using Splenda or its generic substitute for all of my coffee and tea sweetening needs since forever. The problem is, there really is no generic / house-brand equivalent. You'd think by now manufacturers would get the chemical formula down to a science, but it's just not meant to be, I suppose. Which is why I pay extra for name brand: There is a BIG difference in taste and texture. So buying dual Splenda packs makes sense because the volume price is a little lower at retailers and Amazon. But, come on now. Is it really that expensive to manufacture chlorine, which is the base component of this artificial sweetener? (Yes; I know... It's not at all good for you, but I like my 0 calorie sweetness in my coffee and tea, and that's another issue entirely.)

NO CLUMPS.Added the cooked pasta to the bowl. VOILA.NICE THICK consistency, not lumpy, then I tasted it.

I've been on a sardine kick lately. My favorite so far are the King Oscar Brisling Sardines in Olive Oil because they taste fishy and are small. The Season skinless and boneless sardines in olive oil taste less like the stereotypical sardine and more like a kipper. There are about 3 sardines, or at least 3 large pieces of fish in the cans, each has quite a bit of the darker flesh, but there is absolutely no skin and no bone. Although they have salt added, they are not salty to the taste compared to other sardines. Sometimes when a can of sardines is opened, the fish is sort of soft and mushy, but in these that is not the case. I've drained the cans, had them with onions and hot mustard in a sandwich or simply put them on a salad, again with onions. The next can will be cooked with onions and scrambled eggs, like what my mother did with kippers. The cans are structurally sound and have a very light lid that is easy to remove with a lightweight tab. No sharp edges or metal taste seeping into the fish.",202,11,4,0.5915069580078125,0.37346020340919495,0.004170261323451996,0.010264156386256218,0.0050209686160087585,0.004335190635174513,0.011242193169891834,Disgust,0.9467015862464905,0.13438783586025238,0.12166332453489304,0.9596227407455444,0.8483030200004578,0.3842002749443054,0.4492079019546509,0.23987960815429688,0.7430167198181152,0.11847618222236633,0.43375715613365173,0.5234735608100891,0.09546457231044769,0.8963743448257446,Taste and Flavour

4,B079TRNVHX,Grocery,"Tara's All Natural Handcrafted Gourmet Sea Salt Caramel: Small Batch, Kettle Cooked, Creamy & Individually Wrapped - 11.5 Ounce",Tara's,"Tasty, But Not My Go-To Caramels . . . I'm addicted to soft caramels, so obviously, I have a go-to brand. One day, when that brand was out of stock, I had no choice but to search for a decent replacement. I always check the reviews before purchasing an item, and that's when I discovered Tara’s caramels. Tara’s had surprisingly high and positive ratings. The only thing that held me back from immediately ordering the caramels was the steep price tag. However, I was craving soft caramels, so finally, I took the plunge and submitted my order.The caramels came wrapped in an almost butcher-like paper, which made it easy to unwrap the caramels without the frustration of the caramel sticking to its wrapping paper. The caramels were very soft, just the way I like them. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the quantity that came in the container. In regards to the taste, it was a bit different than the original tasting caramels I'm used to having. The hint of sea salt was a nice contrast from what I usually pig  out on. However, if I'm being straightforward, the taste of Tara’s caramels couldn't beat how costly they are. The brand I usually have is nowhere near the price of Tara’s caramels. Maybe that's why I believe Tara’s caramels, while tasty, are not worth the cost. To be completely honest, I would indulge in Tara’s caramels if offered some. I just wouldn't pay for these caramels out of my pocket. On the other hand, if I were offered a free lifetime of caramels, with any brand of my choosing, without a doubt, I would pick my usual go-to brand Werther’s Soft Caramels over all other brands.",287,17,4,0.0032736503053456545,0.14440634846687317,0.7976865172386169,0.002961736172437668,0.005118165165185928,0.0021652360446751118,0.04438833147287369,Surprise,0.7754087448120117,0.4731025993824005,0.5235490202903748,0.9698766469955444,0.8800576329231262,0.42043572664260864,0.9897705316543579,0.7867792248725891,0.863715648651123,0.6249740719795227,0.5085638165473938,0.8127020597457886,0.3669985830783844,0.5175055265426636,Price

Orgain Organic Nutritional Shake, Vanilla Bean - Meal Replacement is pretty good. It is a tad more sweet than I like, and I would prefer more fiber. Usually I make a smoothie using a meal replacement powder, but I wanted some convenient ready to drink option available for on the go, or when I just dont feel like getting the blender out. I also use this as creamer in my coffee.I see there that there are many reviews stating theirs were chunky. I have had a few now, and haven't had any issues thankfully. I poured one into a glass and took a picture so I can show you how smooth my supply is. Purchased June 2021 with best by date of May 2022-------------------Edit to add: I like Orgain shakes enough that I have purchased the vanilla few more times, and I recently purchased the Cafe Mocha. I came here to review the cafe mocha, and my old vanilla review came up. They must be on same page.

4,B07SYVM3F4,Grocery,"Mestemacher Protein Bread,Carrot , 9 Count",Mestemacher,"trusty stand by for very healthy shelf stable bread, high protein is a little off tasting. I have been a consumer of these German breads on and off since childhood. Definitely an acquired taste, or should I say texture. These shelf stable breads are dense, moist, and are best (to me) simply toasted and buttered (or dairy, non dairy, nut butters, etc). I like it for smashed avocado toast, but not so much as a regular sandwich bread. Does better as an open face sandwich bread. Once the package is opened, it is best if it is stored in fridge and used up soon.As for this particular variety-- carrot, it has a nearly neutral carrot taste; hint of carrot. There is another flavor that comes through that is not bad, but makes me less likely to buy it again. I think it is the fact that this is one of their high protein varieties. I normally just go with the regular stuff, and this is my first time trying the high protein kind. I love all the ingredients, but there is a pronounced protein taste. I will definitely use these packages up, then next time I will simply choose one of my usual varieties.

Must love cardamom. I can give it 5 stars for quality, but in the taste category (and overall rating) I am giving it 4 stars. I know this is a preference thing, rather than a quality thing. So if you really like cardamom then go for it. I like cardamom, but this is rather strong. I taste that more than the coffee itself. If I could at least still taste the dark coffee, then I would like this a lot more. If you like strong cardamom then you will be pleased with this. If you want to try this anyway, know that the quality is quite good. I plan to add in some supplemental dark roast without cardamom to see if I can get a more balanced flavor. I never add cream or sugar to my coffee, and I find I need both to mellow out the cardamom.I love a good cup of Turkish coffee. I have learned to look for dark roast, as many of the offerings available tend to default to a light, very green tasting roast. Anytime I have had it in an restaurant, it has always been dark roast, which is my preference for coffee anyway. The darker the better. Black. No sugar. No cream.This small bag (in a box) of coffee is powdery as expected. Dark and rich smelling. I have the ""with cardamom"" option. Like I said.. the flavor is robust. I think I may cut in some fine ground dark coffee, or see if they offer a dark roast without it. I like it enough to finish it, but likely wont buy it again. Yet, I like the quality of the brand enough to want a non cardamom option.I prepare it as it should. I use an Ibrik over a gas burner. I am not good at making it. My foaming skill is not as good as I want, but the coffee at least tastes pretty good. I love strong, bold flavor of Turkish coffee. I never water it down.I really like that this company has so many offerings-- dark, medium, light roasts, some with cardamom, some without. I think I will try the French Roast so long as it doesnt have cardamom (or at least less of it).

However, as it became more popular (perhaps because of paleo thing) it has gotten pricey and limited availability. This was available and also seemed to be the best price per ounce.My only other gripe with the product besides price/availability is the packaging. While it is admirable that it comes in a glass container without a BPA liner and has a plastic overwrap, in shipping it is not quite adequate to prevent leaking. Two of mine arrived leaking, one barely and the other more severely. The lids just weren't screwed down all the way tight or had come looser on shipping. The plastic overwrap cannot contain the liquid ghee becomes when subjected to the merciless heat we have been experiencing these weeks so I had some slippery heavy glass jars to deal with. Cleaned them up, ghee is fine. From the looks of it they may have spent some time upside down too, which again, in this heat, ghee is a liquid so you are going to have spillage in this kind of container.If they would find a way to make an inner seal without BPA that would be great.

Like it enough to keep stacking it. It's got it's purpose, especially these days and upcoming. It isn't bad, and I stack these on my shelf for a variety reasons. Now, anyone expecting a quality beef stew on par with homemade will severely disappointed. This is more like a chunky soup. I can say that is has lots of good sized bits of potato and carrot slices. The background flavor is indeed beef, and I dont find it weird tasting. The beef pieces are spongy, reminiscent of canned ground beef rather than chunks of roast. They list ""beef"", and so whatever that is, it is soft and spongy, and there is plenty of it. The liquid is thicker than a broth but not as thick as a gravy. Add a little flour to thicken it up if need be.Loaded with sodium like most canned goods. Be careful, one can is ridiculously considered ""2 servings"". that will overblow your sodium content for the day.Overall... for what I buy it for.. I am pleased. I dont eat this stuff often. It really isnt my go to. But I do have a robust pantry, and I keep stuff like this on hand for quick desperate meals, for using as a sort of flavor base (keep as is, or blend), for adding over rice, pasta, etc. Make up a bunch of buttered toast and dip it in this? Mmmm yes. Quick, easy comfort food. Got someone who cant chew real well? This stuff can be gummed. Or can be blended to make for a beefy smoothie (gross sounding, but people have issues that may benefit from this knowledge).The price on this stuff has gone up a lot. Inflation, and food shortage combined. If you can get it for less than $3 per can (04/2022) then it is still holding at older pricing (I think $2.85 at DollarGeneral). If you are looking to stack your pantry, this is worthwhile to have. Gives some variety, convenience. Need a can opener. I know reviews are totally unfavorable, but this brand is reasonably (so far) priced, and has the most natural taste. I dont cringe eating it- no off taste, or after taste. Maybe grab a can from the store before committing to a case, or jump on getting the case and keeping it for emergency (or give away).Know what you are getting this for, understand the limitations of taste and texture, and then proceed if you so desire. 4 stars from me.

4,B0BB7FLBN5,Grocery,"Crystal Light Pure Tangerine Mango, 0.14 Oz Box, 7 Pack",Crystal Light,"Add to a Bottle of Water for a Convenient Fast Drink! I've been trying all the flavors of the Crystal Light Pure line. It is interesting to see what flavor combination they have come up with lately. I really loved the raspberry lemonade and tried the tangerine mango. Those are my two favorites.Then I wondered what the grape would taste like. To be honest it tastes great after sitting for about 10 minutes after you mix it all up. I don't know why it tastes so different right after you mix it. It is like the flavors are enhanced if you let it sit a bit. I don't think this tastes exactly like grape juice, it is not that sweet! It is more like you diluted strong grape juice and added a bit of stevia.I would vote for stronger flavors in all their pure drinks to be honest. But if not, I'm happy with them for now. They make water easier to drink and I think that is the point. To keep hydrated!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. I tried the package with less water and the grape flavor is much stronger. So like drink 1/4 cup of the water in a regular 16.9 ounce water bottle so there is less water to flavor.

I purchased the thick version of Stockans Oatcakes, and I liked them enough that I think I'll add them into my typical rotation. I've tried a couple other oatcakes since - Nairns, Walkers - and the Stockans Thick remain on top. As such, I wanted to try an alternative variant, to see how they stacked up.In brief, I like them less. The thick version has more body of course, but the thin ones also seem a bit drier. They re more in line with the Walkers, which are still pretty good on their own. I think I'd want to add some sort of spread to these to make them more interesting, rather than have them straight.So not bad so far as oatcakes go, but the Thick Stockans are preferable in every respect.",138,7,3,0.14037871360778809,0.7542807459831238,0.008705989457666874,0.022291770204901695,0.006971164606511593,0.002418471034616232,0.06495324522256851,Neutral,0.7920846343040466,0.498197078704834,0.08379420638084412,0.8949090838432312,0.5353184938430786,0.5538668036460876,0.23766787350177765,0.5326920747756958,0.8318307995796204,0.2546699345111847,0.42994463443756104,0.6707665324211121,0.32017964124679565,0.5395935773849487,Taste and Flavour

It's actually very expensive, but it's the only cereal my daughter likes and it has a lot of fiber and other good things, so I buy it anyway, but I think that the price should definitely be lower.",122,5,4,0.031544700264930725,0.5248087644577026,0.019769778475165367,0.032873544842004776,0.008073998615145683,0.0014091304037719965,0.38152003288269043,Neutral,0.9300294518470764,0.6592232584953308,0.0765974149107933,0.7861750721931458,0.6764426231384277,0.78389573097229,0.9421363472938538,0.6323517560958862,0.9144397974014282,0.8048123717308044,0.6534124612808228,0.805759608745575,0.3717470169067383,0.8005264401435852,Price

4,B0C551ZCFF,Grocery,Beef Ribeye Steak Boneless Step 1,MEAT,"UPDATE: my 2nd order not so...Excellent - one of the best I have ever had. UPDATE: ordered for a second time. See original review below. This time was not so wonderful just took off a star. After my first five star experience I figured the only was to go from there was probably down. But still not too far. As with my first order I asked for a pound. Since the first one was almost TOO think I figured I would slice thickness and get two steaks out of it and have one suitable for a steak n eggs breakfast. This steak was thinner. Not as marbled and gorgeous as the first. I did debate whether to halve it (I probably shouldn't have but did anyway because I am stupid like that) Got well two thin steaks. Froze one, cooked the other. I figured a quick sear even on cast iron and it should be a perfect medium. Eh, I messed up was more a medium well but it definitely didn't have the marbling or flavor (fat is flavor!) of that first purchase. A few days later and I decide to pull out the frozen half and try steak and eggs. I normally don't cook from frozen but since this was thin I did hoping it would save interior. My, that baby while a perfect sear also ended up well done (UGH). However, regardless of temp I can say my second serve of second order did not have the marbling or flavor of that first ordered single. Still on the fence as to what ""meat"" I will order for xmas. Maybe will go off to the brick n mortar butcher even and pick something out. Still kicking myself for not taking the first steak and saving it for the holiday in the freezer. I still dream about. Beautiful. These two, your average supermarket steak.What can I say? I am old and this has to rank as one of the best I have ever had whether prepared myself or at a steak house. For a steak that is choice grade, this was truly a great value even at what many would consider a high price point. I have seen ribeyes at the supermarket going for more than this per pound. Was it on sale maybe?I had this instead of turkey for Thanksgiving. Actually I made it today on Black Friday as I just wasn't feeling like an indulgent meal yesterday. Did not disappoint. Unwrapped and sprinkled with seasalt on both sides while it got the chill off and dropped it into my biggest cast iron skillet I had preheated. Initially considered slicing it in half thinner as I was concerned if I could get a nice medium (no more no less for me) on the stove top but kept it as it was. Perfect. Made some au jus with the drippings and a spoonful of dark soy sauce. Didn't even need the A1 I had already poured onto a warm plate.I wouldn't hesitate to buy again. Especially at that price. Meat is always a gamble, even when I pick it out myself in person you never really know until you prepare and eat it. Looking forward to it I think I will get it again for Christmas but just get a ham slice in case this was a one-off.At least give it a try. Never would have guessed it is probably only Choice grade, so tender.",577,42,4,0.007019039709120989,0.30772972106933594,0.3873817026615143,0.0616050660610199,0.009135532192885876,0.001298681483604014,0.2258303165435791,Surprise,0.3200856149196625,0.011955968104302883,0.1701389104127884,0.903721809387207,0.291819304227829,0.41205906867980957,0.4651855528354645,0.08720243722200394,0.9379555583000183,0.08585485070943832,0.40602725744247437,0.9500359892845154,0.032853398472070694,0.5527005195617676,Value for Money

4,B07D972FCC,Grocery,Rani Sabudana (Tapioca / Sago) Pearls 64oz (4lbs) 1.81kg Bulk ~ All Natural | Vegan | No Colors | NON-GMO | Indian Origin,Rani Brand Authentic Indian Products,"Works well in savory, traditional, sabudana dishes. I became interested in trying out a recipe for sabudana khichdi a while back, and I purchased this brand of sabudana (AKA tapioca pearls) for that purpose. I also separately purchased curry leaves here on Amazon for that reason as well. I had never tried that particular herb, but it seems to be a main component of traditional Asian, savory, sabudana recipes.Note that tapioca has very little healthy, nutritional value in and of itself, so I would not categorize it as a “health food.” Sabudana has zero fat, which in itself won’t be considered a negative by many people. But, unfortunately, it contains no fiber and no protein, because it entirely consists of starch. I addition, apparently it is quite common, in the process of manufacturing tapioca pearls, no matter who is doing it, that chemical additives are used, particularly during the process of manufacturing tapioca flour from the cassava plant (the pearls are created from tapioca starch). These chemicals typically include:--Sulfuric acid as a bleaching agent. This highly corrosive chemical is actually a common food additive in its “food grade” formulation. It is commonly used in the production of cheese, in the refinement of sugar, in the treatment of drinking water, in the production of whey protein powders, and in the production of many kinds of modified food starch, including tapioca starch.--Aluminum sulfate for increasing the viscosity of tapioca starch/flour. The primary health concern with all forms of aluminum is long-term exposure to low levels of this chemical, which can cause damage to the nervous system. In addition, aluminum from natural sources may contain traces of toxic metals such as chromium.--Sulfur dioxide for percolating out the tapioca starch, as a bleaching agent and antimicrobial. Sulfur dioxide is a sulfite, a preservative that some people are dangerously allergic.--Chlorine as a bleaching agent and antimicrobial. All public drinking water in the USA contains chlorine.In spite of these issues, I may, occasionally, continue to enjoy sabudana as an intriguing, ethnic addition to my vegan diet. I really liked the chewy texture, and when well spiced, sabudana is quite tasty.Pros of this particular product: The sabudana seems fresh, and it worked well in the dish I made with it, which turned out great. The seller, Rani's World Foods, is located in Texas. It is a family-owned company that has been in business over 40 years. It is listed with the Better Business Bureau. It has no complaints against it, though it has no rating.Cons of this product: The seller offers no nutritional information nor any cooking instructions on the package. I have provided information on both below for any customer who might be interested.Nutritional information for 1 cup uncooked sabudana:Calories: 544Fat: 0Carbs: 135 gmFiber: 1 gmProtein: 0SABUDANA KHICHDI RECIPEYield: 5-3/4 cupsCalories: 196 per 1-cup servingIngredients1 cup uncooked sabudana AKA tapioca pearls1/2 cup raw, skinned peanuts, lightly roasted, ground to coarse powder2 medium (2-1/4 cups) potatoes, peeled and diced into small cubes1 cup chopped green onions1 cup frozen spinach1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes1-1/2 inch fresh, peeled ginger root2 tablespoons ground curry leaves (I ground them in my spice grinder)1 tablespoon ground, mild chili pepper (I ground them in my spice grinder)1 tablespoon cumin powder1 teaspoon coriander powder1/4 teaspoon stevia (OR 1 teaspoon sugar)1/2 teaspoon black pepper1/2 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon lemon juice (OR 1 tablespoon lime juice)1 tablespoon coconut oilInstructions1. Rinse the sabudana pearls multiple times in a colander under running water.2. Place the sabudana in a container with 2-1/2 cups of purified water. Stir in 1 teaspoon curry leaves and soak the pearls a minimum of 5 hours, but ideally overnight, in order for them to absorb enough water to soften adequately. You will know they are sufficiently soft when several different pearls crush easily between your thumb and pointer finger when you press on them.3. After it has sufficiently soaked, drain the sabudana and set it aside.4. Peel and dice the potatoes. Boil them with 2 cups of purified water for about 5-7 minutes until soft. Drain and set aside.5. If you are using raw, red-skinned peanuts, roast the peanuts lightly (400 degrees in a toaster oven for 4 minutes), remove the skin, and grind them to a coarse powder in a food processor, coffee grinder, or with a mortar and pestle. Pour the peanut powder on top of the sabudana and mix well, such that every pearl is coated. This helps keep the sabudana pearls from clumping together.6. Place in a food processor or blender all of the remaining ingredients except the coconut oil. Grind them to the consistency of a coarse, moist, green powder. Pour it on top of the potatoes, and blend completely.7. Pour the sabudana and peanut powder mixture on top of the vegetable mixture and blend well.8. Place the coconut oil in a large skillet or wok. Melt it on medium heat and spread it throughout the bottom of the pan. Place the sabudana mixture into the pan and cook it on medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent its sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the mixture is thoroughly hot. Serve immediately.NOTESYou can prepare this mixture ahead of time on the same day you plan to serve it, setting it aside in a covered container, either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. You can then follow Step 8 when you are ready to serve it. It is not recommended to serve this food as leftovers, because it can congeal and get rather gluey. Therefore, if 5-3/4 cups is too much food for your needs for one meal, you might want to cut down the proportions to suit your requirements.I checked out about 15-20 traditional sabudana recipes and ended up creating my own modified recipe. My personal objections to traditional recipes are twofold: not enough flavorful spices and not enough vegetables. I also made a decision to grind up the vegetables I use in my recipe in order to provide a more complete job of coating the sabudana to prevent the pearls from clumping together. Traditional recipes rely solely on the powder from coarse-ground, roasted peanuts to achieve that purpose, but I did not think that this would be adequate enough for my particular preference. I also decided to pre-soak the sabudana pearls with some curry leaves, in order to create a kind of water-based marinade. This experiment definitely worked to boost the absorption of flavor on the part of the tapioca pearls which, in and of themselves, are a tasteless starch. Soaking with curry leaves did not, for me, preempt using more of them in the ultimate flavoring of the dish, because the soaking curry leaves are removed when the water is drained off.Photos left to right: Sabudana prior to soaking, sabudana after soaking overnight, sabudana drained, sabudana about to be stirred into vegetable mixture, completed sabudana khichdi.",1180,48,4,0.23528756201267242,0.5683809518814087,0.005663658492267132,0.022334937006235123,0.009131219238042831,0.009852110408246517,0.14934960007667542,Neutral,0.26966971158981323,0.8214195370674133,0.7608068585395813,0.8536269068717957,0.7684804201126099,0.7960983514785767,0.817692220211029,0.8117319941520691,0.8701406717300415,0.7113684415817261,0.825549304485321,0.658050537109375,0.5061901211738586,0.6994822025299072,Quality

4,B00FCXD5DO,Grocery,"Tasty Brand Organic Fruit Snacks, Mixed Fruit Flavors, 0.8-Ounce Pouches, 24-Count",Tasty Brand,"Tastes great, very expensive, a couple of questionable ingredients. I recently discovered gummy vitamins, and they tasted so good, it made me crave gummy candy, something I had previously never been drawn to, even as a child. I decided if I was going to indulge in candy, I should try to get the least unhealthy brand I could find, which led me to these particular gummies. Since I made a big commitment buying a box with 24 packets of them, I was delighted to discover that they taste great. The texture is terrific, too, not at all hard, but pleasantly soft and chewy.The biggest drawback of this brand is the cost. At the price I paid here on Amazon, these gummies cost about 7 cents each. They are sold in tiny, individual packets with 11 pieces of candy in each, weighing per packet .8 ounce (23 grams). The label on each packet proudly proclaims the candy inside comes to ""only"" 70 calories, but that's a lot of calories for such a small amount of candy. A single tiny gummy has 7 calories.In short, every bite of these tasty gummies is expensive in both calories and cost.Below is a list of ingredients. There are only two that are somewhat problematic, carnauba wax and natural flavors. I have provided information on them. The rest of the ingredients are as acceptable as junk-food ingredients can be. Nothing can counteract the fact that all sweeteners, even natural ones, can have adverse effects on blood sugar, and sticky candy is particularly hard on the teeth because it clings tenaciously to the enamel.Note to vegans: Though these gummies use pectin instead of non-vegan gelatin, unfortunately, the vegan status of the sugar content is a big unknown because it is hard to tell how much processing has been done to the ""organic cane sugar"" listed in the ingredients. That confusingly generic term offers no clue if it was bleached, which often involves the use of non-vegan bone char rather than the vegan-friendly methods of granular carbon or an ion-exchange system.Ingredients: Organic tapioca syrup, organic cane sugar, organic tapioca syrup solids, organic white grape juice concentrate, pectin, citric acid, ascorbic acid, color added (black carrot juice concentrate, turmeric, annatto), natural flavors, sodium citrate, organic sunflower oil, carnauba wax.Carnauba Wax AKA Brazil Wax and Palm Wax. This wax is harvested from the leaves of the Copernicia prunifera, a palm plant that grows only in northeastern Brazil. The trees grow up to 50 feet tall. Their leaves are individually removed by hand, a maximum of 20 leaves per tree, per year, to avoid harming the tree. The leaves are dried in the sun, then beaten to loosen and remove their wax. Carnauba wax has many industrial uses, but its main one is to produce a glossy finish, whether on candy, cars, shoes, dental floss or floors. Because it is hypoallergenic and has emollient properties as well shine, it is frequently used in cosmetics. It is also used for pharmaceutical medications to coat tablets in order to make them easier to swallow. Carnauba wax is regularly used in a range of food products, for example: sauces, chewing gum, candy corn, jelly beans, and gummy candy. As of 2001, the EU accepted usage of carnauba wax in food products up to a maximum level of 200 mg/kg of food and an estimated safe consumption level per individual of up to 8 mg/day. It is impossible to know how much carnauba wax is contained in a serving of this product.Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.Sodium Citrate: This is used in food products as an emulsifier and refers to any one of the three sodium salts of citric acid, and most commonly the third one: monosodium citrate, disodium citrate, and trisodium citrate. Sodium citrate is metabolized to sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), thus acting as a systemic alkalizer.",762,26,2,0.04444527626037598,0.5975254774093628,0.012922954745590687,0.016496235504746437,0.006214244291186333,0.0034855029080063105,0.3189103603363037,Neutral,0.4986150562763214,0.6870140433311462,0.7979684472084045,0.8375507593154907,0.9023556113243103,0.7359994649887085,0.8935527801513672,0.8149815201759338,0.8143596649169922,0.8418025970458984,0.8234274387359619,0.674981951713562,0.5847341418266296,0.39003539085388184,Size and Quantity

4,B002HQNFDO,Grocery,"Taylors of Harrogate, Ntingwe Kwazulu Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.4 Ounce Box",Taylors of Harrogate,"An upbeat breakfast tea that offers a different note. The Ntingwe Kwazulu is without a doubt a breakfast tea. It would not be an all day drinking tea in the sense of having it straight. Definitely has the darker color of a breakfast tea. The taste on the other hand is upbeat compared to other breakfast teas. It doesn't have that same bitterness in the background. Bit on the light side to be there much even for a more concentrated brew.It's more fine than a CTC since there isn't much of a curl. They almost look uniform in cut and a coffee filter would be suggested for this. Not quite the bitterness as the Assam, Ceylon and combination of the two if someone is looking for an alternative to the coffee and cream to start the day.If the idea is to have an alternative to an espresso or Turkish coffee in terms of that heavier taste, I suggest the Assam, Ceylon or combo. This one would be more of an alternative to that brand everyone is familiar seeing at every other street corner or in a mall. Much of the coffee that brand has are from Africa so this would be similar in the lightness or upbeat characteristic.I would say that not every Assam and Ceylon are going to be the same. T of H Assam is weak. Assam is known for the maltiness when you add the milk. Ceylon lends more of the bitterness. To have a good combo of the two that makes a good coffee and cream alternative is the royal blend by F&M. I like the royal blend and this one for a breakfast tea. Main difference is that the royal blend is more addictive for me. This one is good in a different way.For those who enjoy a good breakfast tea, I would recommend this. It does have a twist to it that isn't present in most breakfast teas. It has a tenor note to it at the end. The taste starts off as breakfast and then finishes at the end with a light jump. Many breakfast teas end with a fall vs. a jump. Not fall in a bad way. More of the note being heavier, bitter, characteristics of coffee and a bass note.Taste wise, it's good. In a way, refreshing for a breakfast tea. Full body, but still some lightness to it. Milk and honey/sugar would be suggested for this the way most breakfast teas are better paired with.To compare it to coffee, this is more of a medium roast. For those who want that French roast or espresso, I suggest the Assam and Ceylon. Unlike coffee, it does not have that nice aroma to travel around the room when it is hot.The unique note to the Ntingwe Kwazulu is hard to describe, but it's noticeable in a good way. Can not seem to find any other brand that offers the tea from this region.Anyone who is not familiar with breakfast teas, do keep in mind it is the tea version of coffee minus the strong aroma. They are usually heavier, stronger and meant to be mixed with milk and sugar/honey. There isn't a set rule of what qualifies as a breakfast tea. Most of them are stronger, heavier, darker and is usually an Assam, Ceylon, Kenyan or a combo of any of them.If you're looking for a tea that doesn't require milk or anything at all, the breakfast teas are the ones to stay away from. It's not an all day drinking tea. All day or afternoon drinking tea usually means a lighter tea than the breakfast ones. The flavored teas, the more colorful ones, those are all day drinking teas. Those will always stand out a bit more due to the different ingredients added. Where as the breakfast tea is going to be a tad more on the dull side. The caffeine may wake up the senses, but the taste itself isn't going to be as lively as a peach/ginger tea, a Lady Grey, a tisane and such.For the ones who are experimenting with teas and the different flavors, the breakfast tea is in a whole different category by itself. It's not made to stand out so differently as if you are picking apples, oranges, pears, plums, apricots, berries and such. It's a very subtle type of tea that usually isn't meant to be mixed with anything else that you would find in the afternoon or all day drinking teas.A breakfast tea with a little more distinction, this is the one. Most breakfast teas just has people go ehh. Similar to having toast with butter and plain corn flakes. It's not to meant to be very exciting. Not that it couldn't be, but the base of most breakfast teas aren't made that way. The minor details or subtle differences varies, but that is what has one choose one breakfast tea over the other.You will find that some co. make more than one combo of the same teas. It doesn't mean they all taste the same. Sometimes it varies by grade and they won't tell you or they vary by region or something else. Only way to figure out which one you like better than the other is by trying them. Describing can only go so far. What has that je ne sais quoi for one drinker may not for another.I enjoy the heavier taste of the Assam/Ceylon combo, but then I am one to enjoy espresso and Turkish coffee. This is a 2nd alternative for a breakfast tea if I want something a little brighter. To like something heavier in taste does not necessarily mean that the tea is made more concentrated. A good, heavier tea doesn't require a heavier serving to get a good result. In fact, good teas that are distinctive enough would not require 2-3x the serving to be adequate.The same goes for coffee as well. If something is made well, the one serving is enough to get that taste, texture and over all experience that is most enjoyable. To double the amount in coffee or tea to make it more enjoyable either says the product isn't made well enough to begin with or the person has a heavier palate.You can double the serving into one cup for this tea, but it won't be the same as a Ceylon or Assam. That is because it isn't a Ceylon or Assam. That would be similar to saying that one expects a mushroom of any kind to be covered in any sauce and expect it to be the same experience as having steak. It can be cooked in beef fat and it's still not beef. Not the same texture, taste or over all experience.My advice is if you find a good breakfast tea you like, whether it be an Assam, Ceylon or combo, stick to that. If you want to experiment trying to blend those teas till you find one you like, you will find yourself owning a small tea shop. The combinations are endless. More so than the many combos of Earl Grey.",1190,64,4,0.07534260302782059,0.7655465006828308,0.006350377574563026,0.029777102172374725,0.008484039455652237,0.0014615594409406185,0.1130378320813179,Neutral,0.9226434826850891,0.8275917172431946,0.891291081905365,0.9762800931930542,0.9656242728233337,0.9228496551513672,0.8869112133979797,0.8237972259521484,0.9491389393806458,0.9377209544181824,0.9611717462539673,0.7495059370994568,0.8447198867797852,0.8758522868156433,Taste and Flavour

4,B014VGMLCI,Grocery,"Terrasoul Superfoods Organic Cacao Butter, 1 Lb - Raw | Keto | Vegan | Unrefined",Terrasoul Superfoods,"I didn’t have much luck baking with it. Regarding the general quality of this product, it seems to be excellent. It smells very good, and it seems to be free of any impurities.I personally purchased this cacao butter to experiment with using it in baked goods. The main thing I was interested in making with it was vegan “blondies.” These are brownies made, not with cocoa or cacao powder, but typically with white chocolate. Vegan white chocolate is made with cacao butter, coconut oil, sugar and vanilla. Rather than going to all the trouble of first making white chocolate candy, and then putting it in my blondies, I decided not to worry about that extra step, since my recipe already contained coconut oil, sugar and vanilla.I created my own blondie recipe, after looking on every site I could find with advice on baking with cacao butter, and cross comparing that advice to any vegan recipes I could find for making blondies. Essentially, all any of the latter did was throw commercial white chocolate chips into a brownie recipe minus the cacao powder. That wouldn’t work for me, so I decided to simply adjust my tried-and-true, vegan brownie recipe.I left out the cacao powder and substituted the following for the 1/2 cup of coconut oil my recipe calls for: 1/4 cup of coconut oil plus 1/2 cup of cacao butter. Cacao butter is solid and dense at room temperature. Therefore I needed to liquefy it. To do this, I followed instructions from several professional cooking sites and heated the cacao butter over medium-low heat along with the coconut oil, stirring frequently, until it was fully liquid. Then I proceeded as usual with the assembling and mixing of my revamped brownie recipe.I also baked the blondies the same length of time as I bake my brownies, 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. in an 8 x 8 glass pan. Unfortunately, this proved to be a mistake. When baked that way, my brownies turn out as a gooey type of chewy, which is the ideal texture for brownies. Unfortunately, my blondies were the opposite of gooey. The sugar in the blondies dough crystallized, and as they cooled, the blondies got hard on the edges and only very slightly soft and chewy in the middle.Obviously, it will take some experimentation to figure out how to bake with cacao butter.

You get plenty of sprats in a jar, I'd estimate between 3 and 4 standard sardine tins worth.Personally I like them, and I'd order them again, but I wouldn't want to make them my primary choice of sardines. The smokiness is pleasing but it is also the dominant flavor. In total, a single jar has about 600 calories, and some, but not too much, residual oil. I'd prefer olive oil but rapeseed/linseed oil is fine too, it just doesn't add much character. I don't know if you'd have to refrigerate these after opening - the jar doesn't say one way or the other - but I'd rather not risk it, and though I like tinned fish I definitely don't like it cold.So I would recommend at least trying these, especially if you like tinned fish, and I'd like it if Belveder put out a spiced variant.",191,8,3,0.16010352969169617,0.7360689640045166,0.003730381140485406,0.012682098895311356,0.019230874255299568,0.001696104067377746,0.06648803502321243,Neutral,0.3347555994987488,0.25121864676475525,0.25305694341659546,0.9719569683074951,0.8480519652366638,0.6298748254776001,0.496177613735199,0.5640261769294739,0.9664351344108582,0.34865397214889526,0.48552510142326355,0.7986286878585815,0.24126113951206207,0.5542494654655457,Taste and Flavour

In contrast to many herbal teas, it is quite strong, something I appreciate.

If anything, it seems to settle my stomach, after the fashion of an aperitif.If there are any positive health benefits, I have not noted them, nor did I expect to.I generally take water from a hot water tap, drop the tea bag right into it, and let it steep indefinitely. My sister found this to be far to bitter to stomach, so you may want to start with a shorter steep, but I think it is fine like it is. I generally use one satchet in 20z of water, so it's diluted some.This yellow dock root tea is a little weaker than the Buddah Tea equivalent - ASIN: B00QL8EKOC - and I think I prefer that one to this one, but they aren't really all that different.It is an acquired taste, and many will find it far too bitter to enjoy, but I would recommend trying it at least once.

4,B009EVLREO,Grocery,"In the Mix Gingerbread Cookie Kit, Ninja, 9.5 Ounce",BRAND CASTLE,"Cookies Taste Good, But Decorating Is Difficult. For a packaged cookie mix, this NINJABREAD GINGERBREAD COOKIE KIT makes pretty good cookies. They have a light gingerbread taste, and the icing doesn't leave an unpleasant aftertaste. You will need a couple of extra ingredients to make these: 1/4 cup honey (for the cookies), and 1/2 cup powdered sugar (for the icing).The mix really does produce 20 cookies. One of mine is a round blob (see the photo), because I didn't want to roll out any more dough. However, I could have gotten another Ninja cookie out of it. Before rolling out the gingerbread dough, I divided it into quarters, so I could tell how thick the dough needed to be to get five cookies per quarter.The cute Ninja cookie cutters are included. As you can see, I'm not terribly good at decorating cookies. It was harder than I expected to duplicate the package illustrations to make the gingerbread shapes look like Ninjas. Instead of using the included pastry bag, I used an [[ASIN:B00L9X382O OXO Baker's Silicone Decorating Bottle Kit]], which gave pretty good control. I had to chill the icing in the freezer for a little while, because when I mixed it according to the package instructions it was too thin for decorating purposes. All I could get were runny blobs.Because the decorating was kind of difficult, and the cookies taste like they came from a packaged mix, I rate this item at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",255,13,4,0.4631704092025757,0.47795721888542175,0.006052902899682522,0.028053514659404755,0.008861870504915714,0.005608696956187487,0.010295435786247253,Neutral,0.894465982913971,0.27653369307518005,0.6059312224388123,0.9648923277854919,0.8971587419509888,0.5994367599487305,0.8297389149665833,0.9282265901565552,0.9198777675628662,0.6237761378288269,0.6964922547340393,0.47395676374435425,0.1699323058128357,0.0104950787499547,Taste and Flavour

The restrictions for bringing butter into Canada to suit my needs during my trip is challenging. 20lbs or $20. It is the latter I have to adhere to along with raised eyebrows from custom officials. I am hoping this solves my problems on my next trip in May.I have tried both their ghee and coconut/ghee in my coffee along with my existing MCT oil and it is a definite improvement. The taste is smooth. A little goes a long way, I may just stop buying butter altogether even when I'm at home. It is a bit more expensive, however, the convenience and the flavor is worth it.",176,9,4,0.00786218885332346,0.9495506882667542,0.01106519065797329,0.004048530478030443,0.013085054233670235,0.004318763967603445,0.010069625452160835,Neutral,0.4673752784729004,0.16956348717212677,0.5426837205886841,0.965217649936676,0.7376286387443542,0.5408751964569092,0.7514782547950745,0.6478810906410217,0.9219245314598083,0.2551323473453522,0.5077450275421143,0.9205331206321716,0.1934928297996521,0.21859429776668549,Taste and Flavour

4,B0787ZMD9W,Grocery,Pork Loin Chop Bone-In Step 1,MEAT,"Update: second order Yummy. see my original review of pork chops way below - I ate one immediately and froze the other two. In a week or two placed a second order, follows.I placed a second order of same PC a week or two later. The first order I chose two pounds (received 3 lovely chops w/o tenderloin attached - they were great), scroll down. This order I placed for one pound (hoping to receive two chops of a medium to thick-cut). What a received was one mastodon chop. Really. Straight out of the Flintstones. One single humongous (with tenderloin portion attached) chop that really should be called a roast for two/or 3. Not having a bandsaw I was stuck with either cooking this like a roast or deboning it so I could halve its thickness (keep tenderloin separate). I decided to roast. Mistake. While the tenderloin was tender it had an off-taste (no idea why) but it was all I could eat at first serving. Refrigerated, reheated in air fryer the next day. Darn it was dry. Like the sahara. Ate about half the chop, diced the leftover, soaked in tamari in fridge to throw in rice tonight While I am still a fan of this, my advice is go for a 2lb order. You will probably get 3 chops. You need 4 chops? well go for 3lbs and put some in fridge. Don't chance with a 1lb order (unless you have a bandsaw)Second meat order for delivery and very happy with it (the first was truly wonderful beef ribeye). My only point off was this didn't seem terribly fresh. Not gone over at all but not firm enough, lost a lot of water in package, just a whiff here or there a little off. I had tried to get a qty of 2 chops so guessed at what that might weigh since you order by pound. Ended up with three chops. I can only eat one for a serving (and these were big) so I froze the other two and prepared the one with some good old shakenbake. It cooked up nice, still juicy, no off flavor and quite tender. Would buy again. Will probably try one of the other two prepared differently. I think just some simply seasoning, a good sear in a pan and then into the air fryer to finish off and serve with the au jus from searing and a little worcestshire. The one i had definitely was not dried out so I don't think the s&b is really necessary. Will update how that one goes when I get to making it.",442,31,1,0.007817840203642845,0.7175021767616272,0.14253073930740356,0.01092319656163454,0.0064984941855072975,0.0019532348960638046,0.1127743199467659,Neutral,0.9827383160591125,0.3397859036922455,0.6571441888809204,0.935993492603302,0.9591313004493713,0.32850155234336853,0.7916188836097717,0.5915883183479309,0.8361799120903015,0.9485368132591248,0.3011187016963959,0.22738367319107056,0.2983713746070862,0.0164312906563282,Not as Expected

4,B0C1PFQHDD,Grocery,"Pacific Foods Organic White Bean Verde Chili, 16.5 Ounce Can",Pacific Foods,"Tasty, but sodium content is rather high ... I love a good vegetarian chili, and this harvest black bean is excellent -- a great combination of ingredients, nice consistency, etc. My only quibble is the sodium content -- to get the maximum protein and fiber content, you have to consume the entire can (not a problem -- 17 oz is a good serving size), and in so doing, you also consume 1240mg of sodium -- 54% of the daily recommended value.Those of us who have to watch sodium (high blood pressure/etc.) have to weigh the pros/cons of high-sodium meals and adjust the day's meal plan to accommodate something like this. For example, if I wanted to have this for lunch, I would likely limit my breakfast to yogurt/berries/granola (low sodium) and my supper to a salad topped with some diced grilled chicken with a low-sodium dressing.Something to consider. Yes, I'll purchase this again -- it's really a good veggie chili -- but I'll also be careful to plan to offset the high sodium content.",173,5,4,0.02171947807073593,0.8856737017631531,0.00631286483258009,0.007627015467733145,0.006509624421596527,0.0013301915023475885,0.07082712650299072,Neutral,0.8307992219924927,0.59897381067276,0.44988593459129333,0.973217785358429,0.8987628221511841,0.6773138046264648,0.7183418273925781,0.5783692002296448,0.8785749077796936,0.35714468359947205,0.7479655742645264,0.5082048773765564,0.18475259840488434,0.013392799533903599,Taste and Flavour

4,B09TW3F3WW,Grocery,StarKist Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon - Reduced Sodium - 14.75 oz Can (Pack of 12),StarKist,"Mild canned salmon with bones and skin. The large chunks of salmon are packed really well into these 5 serving cans and if the rest of the case is in a similar condition, I'll be happy. With no added salt, I taste the salmon and nothing but the salmon and I mean all parts of it. The dog enjoyed a few bits of the skin as I prepared it for us humans and since calcium is a pro for our nutrition, we didn't share with her. The cans require a can opener, they are not a pull-tab top. Mine was packed with the top down and therefore since the cans are a little wider at the top than the bottom, the water in which the fish is packed covers more of the salmon. The interior of the cans are a dark slate color, there is no obvious coating, and there is nothing that addresses BPA on the attached paper label. The fish was, ""pulled from the icy cold Alaskan waters,"" and they were, ""cooked and packed fresh from the boat."" It is indeed a mild wild salmon. I tried to trace the fish online at their website but the code on the cans is not valid. It's best by date is 08/20/2022 and about half of the cans have a single tiny dent which is not a big deal for me. The price changes like crazy on this product so I'd suggest tracking it to see the trend.

4,B00KWX688S,Grocery,"Benchmark Bouquets Flowering Fields, With Vase (Fresh Cut Flowers)",Benchmark Bouquets,"The real issue is not if I like them, but if my friend that I sent them to did. I met my childhood friend when I was 10 years old. I remember us playing on the playground, having sleepovers, chatting about boys, talking while away at college, etc. And now years later, after husbands and kids, at almost 50, we still keep touch. She lives in Kansas and I live in HotLanta. So this Mother's Day, I decided to surprise her with some flowers, a kind of special thanks to her for always being there. Of course, she was surprised and pleased (see picture). She said that the sunflowers were beautiful (unfortunately you can't really see them in the photo that she took), and that since some of the flowers hadn't fully opened yet, she was sure to enjoy them over the next few days. I however, wished they had been a little fuller. Perhaps she should have cut the stems a little shorter, which would have made them fill out the vase more but regardless, that was a negative I found about this particular bouquet.

I will take a small dent here and there but most were smashed. WTF. I understand that most products are still good and likely why they end up as a warehouse item (which is where I ordered from), but when it comes to tomato products? Unacceptable. So buyer beware.

My review is to reflect quality of actual product as Muir Glen is a fantastic brand.I dont rate on price. Everyone can see the price before order, we all have different budgets, needs, preferences, prices fluctuate, there are sales, and right now.. prices have simply been rising on everything. If I can get good organic tomatoes at $2 or less per can, then I think that is reasonable (currently $25 with subscribe and save). DO I want to pay way less, yes (actually I got mine on sale at $12 so I did get a great deal, but at cost of mostly dented cans).

They are mostly wheat - dry and light with no additional sweetness. to them. You can eat one directly, which I don't recommend trying more than once, or you can put a couple in a bowl and pour some milk over them, crushing them up afterward with a spoon. They soften immediately, but still retain a little bit of their fiber and body. So they aren't crispy or dense like many wheat flakes tend to be in milk, and they aren't ""goopy"" like porridge.

If you've never had Mexican Vanilla, it has a little bit of a floral presence that is actually pleasant. Just don't over, the vanilla is stronger than you think. Not bad, but think of it like using a seasoning (and really it kinda is). Part of the strong flavor is due to the fact it is alcohol free and doesn't evaporate like alcohol based ones. I've had people compliment the flavor this vanilla. For the money, you can't go wrong. It is mostly real vanilla, but it also contain ""other"" natural flavors. I don't know what that means, but just so you know... It does contain Potassium Sorbate if that bothers you. It's a small amount and I don't use that much at one time, so I figure its safe.Packaging: If you worry about leaking, we laughed at how well it was packaged.

So maybe it is just honey made from lavender blossoms and that is that!~The Rebecca Review,89,7,4,0.006460573058575392,0.26921385526657104,0.053714703768491745,0.01351075991988182,0.005722495261579752,0.0009762344416230917,0.6504014134407043,Joy,0.9983735084533691,0.8384884595870972,0.5313912034034729,0.9693744778633118,0.17010411620140076,0.6450634002685547,0.6744704246520996,0.23910632729530334,0.9659823775291443,0.30466505885124207,0.6959948539733887,0.9080492854118347,0.07126771658658981,0.2586531639099121,Not as Expected

4,B07211LG3P,Grocery,"Folgers Simply Gourmet Natural Chocolate Raspberry Flavored Ground Coffee, 10 Ounces",Folgers,"Not my favorite flavor of the Folgers Naturals, but pretty darn good. I'll admit right now: I am a ""Quality + Price"" snob when it comes to flavored coffee. After years spending upwards of $15-30/bag on high-end, whole-bean flavored coffees, I awoke one day and said to myself: ""My life needs purpose. I shall now search far and wide to find the very best tasting flavored coffee I can buy for the least amount of money.""Okay, Okay...I didn't do that. At all.But if I HAD done, I would be right to stop looking once I found the Folgers Simply Gourmet ""Natural..."" line.I actually buy each flavor in bulk now--despite the fact that a tiny seed of bourgeois pompousness deep inside me feels ridiculous for admitting I landed on FOLGERS...the same company that makes the adulterated, sacrilegious INSTANT coffee my gran used to drink. So I'll say, going in, that you CAN'T go wrong with anything available in the Folgers SG Naturals line.Still, of them all, this is probably my least favorite. Don't get me wrong. It's REALLY GOOD. It's just that I LOVE raspberries, and I think the combination of the chocolate with the raspberries HERE just doesn't land as well as the singular flavours they offer in this line.In the spirit of blatant hypocrisy, though, something I have to admit I DO love is to combine the Naturals Caramel flavor (which is by far my fave) with their Chocolate one, at a ratio of 1:1. THAT combo works MUCH better, and rivals any $20 bag of flavored coffee I've ever bought!",270,12,4,0.5046595335006714,0.2532690465450287,0.029935160651803017,0.019698604941368103,0.16458553075790405,0.008551213890314102,0.019300876185297966,Disgust,0.9657869338989258,0.36772823333740234,0.12586256861686707,0.8989386558532715,0.6008267998695374,0.1349787414073944,0.4486360251903534,0.27539268136024475,0.39059677720069885,0.21299545466899872,0.3771134316921234,0.7944229245185852,0.06125933304429054,0.11583678424358368,Not as Expected

I gave up and decided hey, these are dried fruit, I'll get them, they were actually cheaper than buying plain dried fruit. I wanted this combo with dried cherries and dates both for nutritional purposes and hoping it would help with regularity. These are absolutely delicious, very filling with half a bar being typically plenty, and they work great for the regularity issue as well. The almond bits add a nice texture and flavor. Very appealing soft texture, I would say these reminded me a bit of classic Turkish Delight type candies but with a softer quality and of course much more fruity flavor.

BUT YA GOTTA have something sweet that feels indulgent, satisfying sometimes!THIS IS LIKE GOOEY PB FUDGE with walnuts.I take a SMALL bowl, like a sauce bowl, something about the size of a small cat bowl.TWO HEAPING TABLESPOONS of PB FITAdd JUST enough water that it is still thickAdd TWO DARK CHOC HERSHEY KISSESNUKE SECONDS at a time, keep stirring til choc and pnut butter blendADD ABOUT 10-12 WALNUT HALVES, so 5-6 walnuts (I know high in fat, but I need the omegas)OPTIONAL: Sprinkle with Ceylon CinnamonSOOO SATISFYING, RICH AND FILLING! MORE THAN if I ate a bowl of ice cream.PROS:MORE intense peanut taste than most regular peanut butters!SO much lower in fat so I can incorporate it into my diet moreMUCH easier to blend into smoothies or ice cream shakes than regular peanut butter!I also add to oatmeal (I add a little less water and cook just a tad less, so it's the consistency of cookie dough :-) and it takes like oatmeal peanut butter cookies (also add Ceylon cinnamon and stevia, SO GOOD and HEALTHY)Great SIMPLE ingredientsYou can RECONSTITUTE with water and make a sandwichCOST EFFECTIVE! You really get a lot for the moneyCONS:Maybe I like it a little too much?!",261,10,4,0.02482384629547596,0.4482697546482086,0.0399167500436306,0.01316462829709053,0.01669262908399105,0.001816016505472362,0.4553164839744568,Joy,0.14015664160251617,0.02918522246181965,0.054771456867456436,0.6402487754821777,0.10041137784719467,0.1764838546514511,0.31959325075149536,0.06633757054805756,0.31530681252479553,0.0970994308590889,0.29720255732536316,0.39216721057891846,0.010519918985664845,0.13639594614505768,Taste and Flavour

5,B07B9MN32H,Grocery,"Taylors of Harrogate Herbal Infusions Variety Box, 12 Count (Pack of 1)",Taylors of Harrogate,"Taylors of Harrogate Herbal Infusions Variety Box - great way to try some teas! I wanted to try some Taylors of Harrogate herbal/fruit teas (sorry, infusions), and this assortment seemed like a great way to go. Let me tell you about the various flavors.My favorite is Mandarin & Ginger. Very fruity, almost like juice, and smells heavenly if you love the smell of citrus juice. The ginger is definitely the secondary or tertiary taste here, but there are notes of it in the background to warm up the overall taste. It had a couple of ingredients I wasn't familiar with, but both seem to be related to the blackberry family. They add a tiny hint of sweetness and a very faint herbal flavor. Very nice hot and delightful iced. Overall a winner for those who love fruit tea without too much spice - I've already ordered a box of it.Next is peppermint. It's not as sharp as a lot of peppermint teas area, and I appreciate that. It tastes good on its own, and tastes great with some fruit teas I had around the house. Very nice hot, and it's also good with some milk. I've already ordered more.The rose lemonade smells of both rose and lemon, and it tasted more of rose than I expected and a little less than I expected of the lemon. If that sounds good to you, chances are you'll love it. Otherwise if you're like me, it's best with a couple splashes added and stirred in - yum!Last, for me, is the Sweet Rhubarb. I've had strawberry rhubarb pie and loved it with no reservations. This tea, however, to me had such an unpleasant smell that I literally couldn't bring myself to taste it. Even dry in the bag, the smell was repulsive to me, to the point that I wondered if it had gone bad, but more than one bag smelled that way, so I guess I don't like rhubarb tea.Overall I gave the Taylors of Harrogate Herbal Infusions Variety Box five stars because although I disliked one of the teas, I loved two of them, found the third one tasty, and I got to try them all before committing to a larger box of each. I feel that this is what buying an assortment of anything should be about, and I'm happy I tried this one.",392,20,4,0.30284973978996277,0.13942618668079376,0.011143097653985023,0.034433428198099136,0.007630361709743738,0.007683466654270887,0.49683377146720886,Joy,0.9633270502090454,0.28033924102783203,0.7077832818031311,0.9606664180755615,0.40970441699028015,0.8175456523895264,0.6505821943283081,0.774853527545929,0.9290626645088196,0.6533916592597961,0.942336916923523,0.9734511375427246,0.2811214327812195,0.7913458347320557,Value for Money

On my trips back and forth from Africa to the USA I flew KLM and they always stopped at the Amsterdam airport in Holland. This provided a chance to buy the delicious cookies at the airport. Those cookies however have been changed and now have palm kernel oil in them. So I was looking for a gingerbread-like cookie to replace those and found these. They are crunchy and made with delicious spices. Both my husband and I think these are quite wonderful and I will get them again. The cookies are quite large however so you might find it interesting to eat a whole one in a sitting. They break apart fairly easily so you can portion them out. These would also be perfect as gifts as they arrive in a nice tin. The cookies are individually packaged within the tin so that is nice.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.

5,B0006128P8,Grocery,"McCormick Gourmet Chipotle Chile Pepper, 2 oz",McCormick Gourmet,"Smoky and Spicy. This review is for the Chipotle Chile Pepper seasoning. I used it in a recipe in a new cookbook and wow was it spicy. If you like spicy and smoky this will make your taste buds really happy. It was great used in a mixture of corn and pimentos for a topping on corn chowder. I can however think of many more reasons to use it.I think this will be great in chili, on fajitas and on baked potatoes. Since I now have an entire bottle to use up I will find other ways to add flavor to foods I love. I think this tastes much better than cayenne pepper. It has more nuances and the smoky flavor is prominent.I can see myself using this in a dry rub for spicy ribs. So much to love about this particular chile pepper. I'm going to look into other McCormick Gourmet offerings because this is so good I can't wait to see what else they have.~The Rebecca Review",170,12,4,0.017754456028342247,0.30922985076904297,0.07942438870668411,0.009542406536638737,0.008065427653491497,0.0018049143254756927,0.5741785764694214,Joy,0.15853068232536316,0.043419625610113144,0.13229963183403015,0.8671067953109741,0.04111914709210396,0.029614223167300224,0.34501466155052185,0.04528871551156044,0.8665717840194702,0.0846957340836525,0.3324044942855835,0.6112529039382935,0.009877191856503487,0.058103445917367935,Taste and Flavour

These are my favorite of this style of pickled veggie pack that I've tried... the cauliflower seems to balance out the sourness a bit better than artichokes and asparagus.

5,B00EJLJZNY,Grocery,"Great Lakes Pure, Beef Gelatin, 16oz 4-Pack",Great Lakes Wellness,"A great protein source. This gelatin has been a great tool in getting my kids to eat more protein without the taste of meat. I use it in homemade fruit snacks, and it gives them more protein than a yogurt for their afternoon pick-me-up. I use it for homemade marshmallows, jello and a quick substitute when I don't have bone broth to drink. It is helpful with strengthening joints, weight loss and the health of hair and nails. Seriously amazing stuff! There's 6g of protein per Tbs. of gelatin powder. It gels quickly so I recommend heating part of the liquid you are putting it in as well as having an immersion blender (or a really quick, strong hand to whisk). Just a small warning with the fast gel action - it will clump if you add too much and don't start stirring right away. I highly recommend it nutritionally, and for that reason I give this product 5 stars.",161,10,5,0.0515516996383667,0.7328700423240662,0.03630257397890091,0.005136869382113218,0.009155787527561188,0.005191783886402845,0.15979121625423431,Neutral,0.3342980444431305,0.5426053404808044,0.29792386293411255,0.4667394459247589,0.8076407313346863,0.5882734656333923,0.6279088854789734,0.4881783723831177,0.8810385465621948,0.4351320266723633,0.6501683592796326,0.9257190227508545,0.23146699368953705,0.6491881012916565,Value for Money

The broken ones taste as good as the unbroken ones. :-) So far, I've had no sleeves with total disintegration of the contents. But if you're looking for perfect presentation, bear in mind that you're probably going to have to deal with some breakage.That said, I'll purchase these again. The price is comparable to my local supermarket, and having it delivered is a convenience I'm willing to pay a bit extra for. The dark chocolate flavor is divine -- definitely 5-star worthy in my book.",208,12,5,0.06207995116710663,0.7399864196777344,0.03578729182481766,0.03265547379851341,0.010341116227209568,0.0017097684321925044,0.11743992567062378,Neutral,0.7536341547966003,0.2789480686187744,0.4804728627204895,0.9925500750541687,0.841316819190979,0.09290941804647446,0.8526071906089783,0.7246671915054321,0.9869275093078613,0.9549988508224487,0.5954572558403015,0.9804543256759644,0.21187368035316467,0.5307924747467041,Taste and Flavour

5,B0C217MTMT,Grocery,"Walker's Shortbread Fingers, Pure Butter Shortbread Cookies, 5.3 Oz (Pack of 6)",Walker's,"Fingers and Highlanders are both reviewed. FINGERS: These are cookie sticks, not fingers. When Alexa announced that my fingers were out for delivery, I was taken aback until I recalled ordering the Walkers shortbread cookies. Walkers knows how to make nice cookies for having with a cup of tea and the ""fingers"" are the shape that's best suited for dunking. They are also great for dunking in melted chocolate as a base for crystallized ginger or some almond slivers if you're so inclined. You don't have to spill the beans and let folks know that you didn't actually bake the shortbread yourself because they will be so impressed by how cute they are on a plate. If you purchase the package of 6 little boxes, you can always wrap a ribbon around one and present it as a quick gift, perhaps with a little box of tea. Be forewarned, though, that even though the box is petite, it's not intended as a single treat. Each cookie is a mere 100 calories and I wouldn't call that terrible for a treat that's not overly sweet.HIGHLANDERS: Oh wow, I don't even care that each of the several boxes of these arrived in its own plastic envelope with no other padding or protection and some arrived broken. They are that good. Round, thick, a little salty, a little flour like, a little buttery, and a nice edge of sweetness from the demerara sugar. What I received are baked on the lighter side, not even brown, so they are not as hard as some shortbread cookies. I purchased these to share but since they are broken, I'm transferring the broken ones to my own cookie jar and repackaging the whole cookies into tins for distribution. If you need 6 intact cookies, I'd recommend buying two packages.",302,14,4,0.0928044468164444,0.21884392201900482,0.6242277026176453,0.007833310402929783,0.021257538348436356,0.029851095750927925,0.005181953310966492,Surprise,0.9296536445617676,0.16229484975337982,0.12036777287721634,0.174359992146492,0.6311619281768799,0.10805810242891312,0.19512085616588593,0.6419026255607605,0.7173382639884949,0.80424565076828,0.2794705331325531,0.307870090007782,0.13037633895874023,0.2680978775024414,Not as Expected

5,B00BSYE6O8,Grocery,Organic Essiac Tea,Starwest Botanicals,"Excellent tea for treating pets cancer. This tea has been great for treating a pet with liver cancer. Along with other supplements and this tea we have been able to stabilize the health of a cat with advanced liver cancer. He has been living with cancer now for two years and seems to still be doing great. Between taurine, liver supplements, and this tea it has all helped keep his quality of life very high even with a terminal illness.The taste has a light, herbal, and earthy type of taste. It does not have any sort of fruity taste. This tea was easily syringed into our cats mouth. He actually did not try spitting it out at all and seemed to take it better than just straight water. While he probably would not drink it out of a bowl on his own, the taste was not discomforting to him at all.This bag has 4oz of loose tea. I found the quality to be quite good.Pros:*Neutral taste*Helped stabilize cat's healthCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:Consult a vet when it comes to giving your pet anythingIf you are going to brew this, it is a loose tea.

I'm becoming a fan of Palmetto Farms after first enjoying their corn grits. I also love the muslin in which they market the corn.

I use these perfect portion sized packets on my plain low salt tortilla chips to give them that lime taste and without the salt, sugar, or other flavors that are undesired. The overall flavor is pretty close to a lime and without the bitterness that is commonly found when trying to use your own fresh limes. I appreciate the fact that there is some peel in there too. Either the lime or the lemon flavor would be useful for those who are on a low salt diet, as the citric acid naturally found in both fruits help to satisfy some of the same receptors in your mouth that salt satisfies. I use these packets to help flavor rice ramen, tacos, margaritas, and even my evening miralax water (it makes it taste so much better). I greatly appreciate the huge box, as the smaller containers get pricey if you use a lot of them frequently. I did save 1 of the 100ct boxes as a easy go-to for quick grabs of the packets. The 50 and100ct boxes have options available to hang on the wall, pretty handy.",194,9,5,0.11346229165792465,0.6608536839485168,0.012341395020484924,0.019993657246232033,0.030853355303406715,0.0007407296216115355,0.16175487637519836,Neutral,0.04384686052799225,0.09735295921564102,0.1720527708530426,0.8865578174591064,0.868627667427063,0.42816296219825745,0.6829241514205933,0.7838937044143677,0.9527472257614136,0.43461674451828003,0.3988710343837738,0.9734734892845154,0.08346421271562576,0.7040767669677734,Value for Money

5,B09N39TQBS,Grocery,"SunyamGo Food Flavoring, 10 Packs Concentrated Flavoring Extracts Flavors for Baking Candy Lip Gloss Making, Water and Oil Soluble - Vanilla Chocolate Watermelon Banana Mint Caramel .35 Fl Oz Bottle",SunyamGo,"More Delicious Flavorings Than I've Ever Tasted Before! If you bake a lot and want to add some food flavorings to your icings and cakes these are an excellent choice. I first tried the caramel flavor in a vanilla protein drink and was impressed that I could get such a good tasted from six tiny drops. So these are very concentrated and a little goes a long way.Next I made a strawberry icing. It was great. I then added coconut and banana flavoring and came up with something really unique. So using one flavoring is good but you can also combine the flavors for chocolate banana, chocolate mint, strawberry chocolate, watermelon banana and vanilla cream.The flavors you get in this package include: strawberry, coconut, watermelon, chocolate, vanilla, blueberry, mint, cream, caramel and banana.Now I will say that tasting these flavors straight from the containers does not give you a good idea of what the flavor is going to taste like. I tried that! You really need to put it in sweetened food to get the full range of deliciousness.If you want to test out flavors I suggest either putting them in sweetened milk and drinking it or putting 3 tablespoons confectioners' powdered sugar in a bowl, using a spatula to blend in 1/2 teaspoon salted butter then a few drops of whipping cream. This gives a nice icing base for you to test the flavors. Add a few drops of what you are considering and mix in well. I can promise you, you will be impressed!These flavors are better than anything I've tasted that is made in America. These flavorings are made in China and they obviously have access to some really great food grade ingredients and realistic artificial flavorings.The ingredients include: Food Extracts, Water, Propylene Glycol, Natural and Artificial Flavors.This arrives in a cute box that keeps all the flavorings organized. It fits nicely in my kitchen cabinet.Other ways to use these flavorings would be to put them in ice cream, milkshakes and coffee drinks. I have not tried them in beauty products but I guess they would work well in sweetened lip balm.I'm very happy with these flavorings and love them! I think you will enjoy using them too.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. I made chocolate caramel cupcakes and strawberry cupcakes using these flavorings They are great! You literally need just a few drops for really good flavor.",401,20,5,0.014214567840099335,0.35596346855163574,0.1674961894750595,0.005709934048354626,0.010771307162940502,0.0015280896332114935,0.44431647658348083,Joy,0.7932645082473755,0.6174455881118774,0.7003514170646667,0.961417555809021,0.9409274458885193,0.8826858401298523,0.7529079914093018,0.9540375471115112,0.9777031540870667,0.7738297581672668,0.9627606868743896,0.9273151755332947,0.5926634073257446,0.9165078997612,Quality

5,B00ZGKXEFW,Grocery,"Lotte Milkis Soft Soda Variety Favor (Melon, Pack Of 6)",Lotte,"DELICIOUS sodas! I even use them for cocktails too! I'm now addicted to these drinks!!! The first I tried was the Melon, then the Banana, and now I placed an order for another Melon + the Strawberry and and Peach! I have traveled around the world but never came across these drinks till I saw them on Amazon. The price is steep BUT the taste is awesome imo! It's not like the American soft drinks or carbonated sodas - the flavor is just enough without being overwhelming and the carbonation is minimal (i.e. Pepsi, other fruit flavoured sodas). Not only are they great (and thirst-quenching) for drinking alone, but I also use them to make cocktails! One example of one using the Melon flavor is (I don't really measure, just kinda eyeball the amounts or ratios of ingredients, but you can always adjust them to your liking): 2 - 2 1/2 parts Midori (Japanese) Melon liquor, 1 - 1 1/2 parts vodka (I found one in a melon/dragonfruit flavor by Svedka brand, but you can use another complementary flavor, or brand). Add these to a tall rocks glass with ice and then fill with this Melon soda and stir well. Be careful not to shake the soda since it does have some light carbonation which will go all over the place if you do. Adjust amounts as you like after tasting. This makes, imo, a great tasting and very light alcoholic beverage - perfect for summer! For those who like the other flavors just as much (or more) as the Melon, you can still make the same drink by adding another flavor vodka and ‘liquor’ (like a banana). My favorite brand is Giffard, made in France since the 1800’s, and not cheap either, if you can find it! They make other great tasting flavors too like peach and grapefruit, lychee, etc. and they taste really good on their own too! The only thing I wish is that these drinks didn't come in a can, but instead with a twist off cap which would keep the fizz if you don't finish the whole can at once, but otherwise great beverage, in spite of the price!",364,18,5,0.04924643039703369,0.5472604632377625,0.07977297902107239,0.009574640542268753,0.020014433190226555,0.00425046356394887,0.28988054394721985,Neutral,0.04408705234527588,0.007763231638818979,0.046825703233480453,0.9576120972633362,0.08587983250617981,0.04508434608578682,0.43097883462905884,0.07385668903589249,0.9411481022834778,0.09180783480405807,0.8681521415710449,0.31798040866851807,0.004458438605070114,0.27215123176574707,Taste and Flavour

5,B0043E6P58,Grocery,"LaCroix Sparkling Water, Pamplemousse (Grapefruit) 8 pack",Lacroix,"Very pleased - will definitely purchase again! I was really not sure what to expect from this product. I'd read the reviews, and they ranged from ""gross"" to ""crisp and light"".I couldn't find it locally, so finally ordered one on Amazon.Now, I LOVE carbonated drinks. I've never bought a Soda Stream though, because there's no place around here to get canister refills, and most of the syrups were disgusting, so no point. I've been drinking sodas, but want to wean myself off the cola type drinks. I thought this might be a good compromise, as I don't really like plain water.I bought two brands to try - the other one (not naming it here, since this is a review about LaCroix, but it was strawberry dragonfruit. It was gross, and I love dragonfruit) was NOT good at all, so I almost didn't want to try this one! That would have been a mistake.This comes very close to Sierra Mist, IMHO. Of course, it isn't the same, since there is no sweetener in it. That's right - no sugar, so salt, no fake coloring. Clear and bubbly. It was very good. The colder, the better. I tried it right from the case and it was meh. But, stuck a few cans in the fridge and let them get nice and cold (I don't always have access to ice), and it improved it a great deal.I can see this being a regular part of my drink lineup. It will help me not drink so many sugary sodas, but still give me the carbonation I love.The light lime taste is nice, and I am a big fan. You could float lime slices in it if you wanted it more pronounced.LaCroix, you did a GREAT job with this one, and you've won me over. Wish I could find you in our area, but I'll spoil myself and get it here until it arrives. Will be happy to try the other flavors as well.

5,B00MV8ZRZM,Grocery,PNM Cacao Powder Organic Raw Unsweetened Cocoa (3 Pack 16 Oz),Pure Natural Miracles,"This is amazing cacao powder, and can be used to make chocolate sauce and chocolate (nut, soy, rice, or dairy) milk. Enjoy! Having given up dairy and chocolate milk powder, I had to find another way to make my own chocolate soy milk and chocolate dip. This power is amazing. All one has to do is to mix up powder and a bit of sugar, add hot (boiling, or nearly so) water, and stir. I have settled on a ratio of 1 level tablespoon of cacao powder and one level teaspoon of natural german sugar--this cuts the bitterness enough to make it good to add to coffee or to soy milk, or to refrigerate and use as a chocolate sauce. It was too bitter for me with less sugar, but your tastes may be different. I tried making a 5 tbsp. cacao powder and 5 tsp. sugar mix (with hot water, of course), stirring it really well, and then refrigerating it. Imagine my surprise when it turned into a thick shiny brown chocolate sauce! I was so excited, I tried it on nearly everything (OK, almond butter and rice crackers, with chocolate sauce drizzled on top)--SUCCESS! I now know that I can use this mixture just as I would have used cocoa powder or chocolate drink mixes in the past. The flavor is deep and wonderful, and is absolutely vegan.",232,12,5,0.008322518318891525,0.12972453236579895,0.4878406822681427,0.004711865447461605,0.024523748084902763,0.00247820932418108,0.3423984944820404,Surprise,0.9259337186813354,0.1613703817129135,0.32502201199531555,0.9294602274894714,0.6471516489982605,0.5948522686958313,0.5066181421279907,0.2776792049407959,0.8143748641014099,0.40331706404685974,0.7361526489257812,0.8194873332977295,0.12553757429122925,0.9544012546539307,Easy to Use

We have recently started to buy the smaller 8-inch Boboli pizza crusts, but that size does not come with the sauce like their other crust sizes.Lately this sauce in the boxes has been hard to find…what’s going on Boboli?Even though this was a bit pricey, I was happy to buy this set of five boxes with the usual 3 bags of sauce in each box.They arrived today and the expirations dates are a month of so far out, so I decided I would freeze three of the boxes. I did a bit of research and found pizza sauce can be frozen.For the small pizzas I use half of a packet of sauce on each 8-inch pizza. We found our store brand (Pavilions) turkey pepperoni to be good and then we add shredded Italian cheese. Pop it into the toaster oven for 7 1/2 minutes on 450 degrees (no preheating) and it’s perfect for me.

5,B07W7X6TPZ,Grocery,"Yupik Nuts Raw Shelled Filbert Hazelnuts, 2.2 lb",Yupik,"Fresh and delicious. My order of these hazelnuts was fresh and well packaged. The nuts have an excellent taste. Because nuts of any kind can become rancid, I store these hazelnuts along with all my nuts in the refrigerator and/or the freezer.I got these raw, shelled hazelnuts specifically to make a homemade version of Nutella. The Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) describes Nutella as “more sugar and modified palm oil than hazelnut.“ Palm oil is not only unhealthy, but it is associated with horrendous abuse of plantation workers, including sexual abuse, and my personal goal is to avoid it.The seller of these nuts, Yupik, is located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The main hazelnut producing countries are Turkey, Italy, Spain, USA and Greece. These particular hazelnuts are sourced from Turkey.Below is my (relatively) low-sugar recipe for homemade Nutella, for anyone who might be interested. I’ve also attached photos of it.HOMEMADE NUTELLA, CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT SPREADIngredients1-1/4 cup (176 gm) hazelnuts lightly roasted and skinned5 tablespoons cacao powder1 tablespoon coconut milk powder1 tablespoon agave nectar1 tablespoon maple syrup1 tablespoon honey1/2 teaspoon monk fruit powder1/2 teaspoon stevia3 big dates (21 grams)1 tablespoon vanilla1 teaspoon cherry extract OR almond extract (optional, enhances flavor of chocolate)3 tablespoons purified waterInstructions1. Roast hazelnuts in toaster oven on 400 degrees for about 5 minutes, until they are lightly browned.2. Place the nuts on a terrycloth towel and fold it over on top of them. Rub the nuts briskly against each other and the rough texture of the fabric in order to loosen their skin and remove as much of it as possible. Do not worry if absolutely all of the skin is not removed. Note: Another option is to place the roasted nuts in a wire-mesh colander and rub them briskly against the wire mesh to loosen their skin.3. Blend the nuts and all the other ingredients on high speed in a Vitamix or a food processor until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add additional water 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, in order to increase the creaminess to a desired consistency.Yield: 1-1/3 cups (22 tablespoons)Calories: 63 per tablespoon (commercial Nutella is 100 calories per tablespoon)",375,16,4,0.33959057927131653,0.5349437594413757,0.004269423428922892,0.019552994519472122,0.044472210109233856,0.05176391825079918,0.005407128948718309,Neutral,0.21038807928562164,0.029809892177581787,0.11063593626022339,0.8979958891868591,0.5326418280601501,0.9198816418647766,0.4956284463405609,0.6518185138702393,0.9490930438041687,0.4705529510974884,0.777341365814209,0.7030852437019348,0.10022183507680893,0.5995596051216125,Quality

5,B01936PVS2,Grocery,Druids Grove Lactic Acid ☮ Vegan ⊘ Non-GMO ❤ Gluten-Free ✡ OU Kosher Certified - 8 oz.,Druids Grove,"Excellent for making vegan cheese. I purchased this lactic acid as an ingredient in making vegan mozzarella cheese. Along with nutritional yeast, it helps impart to vegan cheese the authentic flavor of dairy cheese. This seems to be an excellent brand of lactic acid for making vegan cheese. It is a white, granular powder that seems to be free of impurities. It is certified non-GMO, vegan and Kosher.Below is general information about lactic acid.Lactic acid was first produced for commercial use 60 years ago, but it is only within the past two decades that it has been consistently utilized both in processed food and in cosmetics. Lactic acid is manufactured commercially by two distinct methods: fermentation or chemical synthesis. European nations tend to use fermentation, and in the USA it is mostly produced by chemical synthesis. Vegan versions, such as this product, are extracted from cane or beet sugar.In food, lactic acid acts to reduce levels of pH. Variations in pH must be carefully controlled in processed food because it can impact the degree of sour flavor of food, its consistency, and its shelf-life. Speaking of the latter, lactic acid is a safe preservative frequently used in processed food due to its ability (like many other natural acids such as vinegar and citric acid) to limit microbial growth.Examples of uses of lactic acid in processed foods include: sourdough bread, beer, wine, bottled beverages and alcoholic cocktails with a sour flavor, meat products, and dried egg white. In bottled Spanish olives, it prevents spoilage and stalls further fermentation. Controlling pH is particularly important in every type of dairy product, from butter, to cheese, to yogurt and other fermented milk products. In dairy cheese production, lactic acid is also a natural flavoring agent.In cosmetics, lactic acid is currently a very popular type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), which is marketed to help heal acne and reduce winkles. It achieves these goals mainly by exfoliating the skin (sluffing off the top layer). However, according to the FDA, lactic acid increases the skin's sensitivity to damage from the sun, so if you go outside much, you could be defeating the purpose of reducing wrinkles if you utilize cosmetics that contain lactic acid.",370,16,5,0.13505440950393677,0.8308926820755005,0.0033668261021375656,0.0077530923299491405,0.009394761174917221,0.003116147592663765,0.010422086343169212,Neutral,0.04177302122116089,0.07886259257793427,0.17951862514019012,0.7457188367843628,0.14608453214168549,0.2514400780200958,0.4250207841396332,0.03381873667240143,0.9254627823829651,0.2955951690673828,0.5155976414680481,0.47513318061828613,0.08446703106164932,0.646151065826416,Quality

Each package contains four little squares of ""goodness,"" which doesn't sound like a lot, but they're so flavorful and rich-tasting that four is really sufficient for an after-meal treat.You get twelve packages in the box, so these make sense to me from an economical standpoint. None of my local supermarkets carry these, so Amazon comes to the rescue here.The only negative I can think of is that, like most chocolate, these probably won't travel as well during the warmer summer months. I live in the Pacific NW, so our summer temps aren't as bad as they are in other parts of the country, but it does occasionally reach high-80s / low-90s for a few days.

I love Werther’s Soft Caramels because of how soft and fresh they genuinely are. After tasting them the first time, I can’t resist them. Just thinking of Werther’s Soft Caramels makes my mouth water. It would be fair to call me a caramel addict. Therefore, I’ve tried many different soft caramels, and they were all decent, but in regards to value, none of the other brands came close to Werther’s. Keep in mind, the only reason I tried these other brands was due to Werther’s Soft Caramels being out of stock. As a result, I tried Tom & Jenny’s Sugar-Free Soft Caramels, which were great especially considering that they’re sugar-free. However, you can’t ignore the hefty price tag for such a small quantity. Then I tried Tara’s Gourmet Sea Salt Caramels. In my opinion, they were very soft, yet still not as tasty as Werther’s. Tara’s container comes with a decent amount of caramels, but being straightforward, I believe Tara’s caramels are more expensive than they should be. With that said, I prefer to stick with Werther’s because their soft caramels are both delicious and cost-efficient.",194,13,5,0.030231576412916183,0.7771908640861511,0.015433325432240963,0.005828494671732187,0.006193989422172308,0.0016351337544620037,0.1634865552186966,Neutral,0.4084695875644684,0.39312100410461426,0.5118312835693359,0.9395242929458618,0.8557954430580139,0.9509352445602417,0.9920394420623779,0.7609450221061707,0.98049396276474,0.5215997695922852,0.5470030307769775,0.9901516437530518,0.3314628303050995,0.6133184432983398,Price

5,B087KFPY2X,Amazon Home,"KIND Sweet Cayenne BBQ Sweet and Spicy Bar, 10g Protein",KIND,"Flavored Almonds are ALL the RAGE, Now They Are Easy On-The-Go! I love KIND bars. When the more exotic flavors like chocolate chile came out, I raced to buy them.I raced to buy these, too.Do you like those Blue Diamond wasabi, BBQ, or habanero almonds in the little tins? If so, you'll LOVE the STRONG & KIND line of KIND bars. It's similar to those delicious and strongly flavored almonds without the coating coming off on your fingers.

5,B07GDSHYJS,Grocery,"Chupa Chups Mini Candy Lollipops, Variety Pack of 7 Assorted Flavors, Individually Wrapped Suckers for Parties Office Concession Classroom, Pack of 240",Chupa Chups,"Delicious! Great Variety of Yummy Flavors. I sell nail polish online. When I ship polishes to customers, I like to include a little treat. When I ran out of the other lollipops I'd been sending, I decided to try Chupa Chups mini lollipops. The bag contains 240 mini lollipops in 5 flavors: strawberry, cherry, creamy strawberry, orange and chocolate/vanilla. All 5 flavors are great. Our family especially loves strawberry cream and chocolate/vanilla. It is easy to tell the flavors apart-the flavor name is on the wrapper and each flavor has a different colored wrapper. The lollipops are very fresh. I've yet to find any that are broken. (I have to sample them, don't I? ;) ) My only complaint and its not really a complaint, more like an 'FYI'...some of the wrappers are on the candy pretty tight and aren't the easiest to get off.I have dental work including fillings, crowns and dental implants. I don't have any issues with the lollipops though I am extremely careful and don't bite the candy until its TINY.These lollipops are perfect when you're craving something sweet, nice to put out in a candy dish at home or at work, perfect for trick-or -treating, etc. The price is more than reasonable-the flavors are good, candy is fresh and delicious and 240 mini pops are the bag.Definitely recommended!",227,15,5,0.010908255353569984,0.3187766671180725,0.026046840474009514,0.009523668326437473,0.006636945065110922,0.0012850846396759152,0.6268225908279419,Joy,0.6062843203544617,0.1541292816400528,0.6387196183204651,0.9399455189704895,0.9286136031150818,0.9555584192276001,0.9537459015846252,0.8857779502868652,0.9757902026176453,0.900953471660614,0.6357648968696594,0.9913740158081055,0.5396912097930908,0.7995180487632751,Value for Money

These little cookies are so delicious, they are to die for. I lost 44lbs of pandemic weight in less than six months on keto and these delicious morsels of goodness make me want to remain on ai Keto food plan for weight maintenance. They are THAT GOOD!I started with the Chocolate Chip and was amazed by the flavor, They taste very similar to the sugared version with all the rich delicious flavor, but I don't go crazy on them because they don't kick up my carb cravings, and they are very satiating.Once I knew how good they are I purchased the variety pack that includes Snickerdoodle, which has a rich coconut flavor with just the slightest hint of cinnamon.The Brownie Bites tasstes like a dark chocolate cookie that is a little bit sweetier than the chocolate flavor of an Oreo cookie.They're are not chewy soft or crunchy hard, and they are dense and flavorful with a nice texture. I like to keep them in the fridge and enjoy them with glass of unsweetened almond milk as a treat.I LOVE all of them with Chocolate Chip being my favorite.

5,B0C5SR7LP5,Grocery,"Stacy's Flavored Pita Chips, 1 Ounce (Pack of 24)",Stacy's,"Ah, FELLOW AMAZONIANS, THE SACRIFICES I made to bring you this review :-). Before writing a review of these, I tried all three flavors over 24 hours. How ELSE could I do a proper review?!THINGS I LOVE:TASTE - Well if they don't TASTE good, nothing else really matters. I tried the GARLIC and HERB first as I was a tad reticent. I am not a big fan of garlic. Not bad, but if you really don't like garlic, you won't like these. Not horrible. NOT my fav. It's a small bag, so you're not eating a bunch.The CHEESE was yummy, flaky and crispy. DEFINITELY would buy again.Strangely, I like the SEA SALT BEST. JUST the right amount of salt, light and flaky. PERFECT for dips. YUMMY on their own.TEXTURE - next to taste, TEXTURE is huge. I was a little concerned this would be SO much thinner, wouldn't work well with dips. Well, for me, they do. Now if you were going to try to put a lot on them, really scoop up something heavy, maybe not. BUT considering HOW FLAKY (LOVE THAT) and CRISPY (LOVE THAT TOO), these make good little dippers!THE TEXTURE of these chips is AMAZING. I like to crumble them up and put on top of anything that needs a bit of crunch. Get creative. Casseroles, sandwiches, I make rice dishes that just need a bit of crunch, these are great. OH and the CHEESE chips are PERFECT crumbled on top of mac n cheese before serving!PRICE - FOR 24 BAGS, EXCELLENT price. With tax, they were about 11 bucks. Granted, small sizes, but PERFECT size for me.FRESHNESS - They tasted VERY fresh.NO REAL CONS, BUT ONE: CHECK EXPIRATION DATE! These are not made to be shelf stable forever, which is why they're flaky. So expiration date is not usually very far off. Out of multiple orders, I only got one order that the expiration date was passed by the time I received them.",326,29,4,0.23501482605934143,0.4048252999782562,0.1218503788113594,0.02783053368330002,0.06583177298307419,0.134190633893013,0.010456575080752373,Neutral,0.7457692623138428,0.3600108325481415,0.24551892280578613,0.8440008163452148,0.5942206382751465,0.525718629360199,0.8354801535606384,0.41327449679374695,0.4634624421596527,0.16929903626441956,0.5061498284339905,0.8427315950393677,0.8195897936820984,0.3261687159538269,Taste and Flavour

An instant steel cut oatmeal?Are you kidding me?Any oatmeal that comes out of the microwave is a vile, gooey, slimy, mess.Steel cut oats are chewy...a perfect balance of comfort and health.And they take a half hour to prepare.I make steel cut oats quite often, usually in big batches so they can be reheated over the course of a few days.When I saw these, I thought I'd give them a try.Never have I been so happy to be wrong about a product. Unbelievably, these oats actually have the taste and texture close to slow cooked steel cut oats. They are even packaged cleverly. The box turns into a holder so that they can sit invitingly on the counter top.To microwave, tear open the top of a pouch, empty into a bowl or mug, and (drum roll) you fill the empty pouch to the water line with cold water, stir and nuke. No measuring cup needed! Also no need to stir halfway.I like my oats extra chewy so I use slightly less water and shave a few seconds off the cook time.Brown sugar, perhaps a bit of butter or a splash of cream, and get ready for a perfect day.",204,9,5,0.9642691016197205,0.0090866107493639,0.004284771624952555,0.0023190465290099382,0.014382338151335716,0.004931682720780373,0.0007265746826305985,Disgust,0.9766688942909241,0.4406781792640686,0.16187022626399994,0.8551959991455078,0.29049476981163025,0.40564048290252686,0.45808011293411255,0.9046838283538818,0.9376748204231262,0.21177472174167633,0.3340044319629669,0.43349939584732056,0.11485075205564499,0.784887969493866,Not as Expected
